# Add SDK examples and more

# Add SDK examples

> Display SDK code samples in your API documentation.

If your users interact with your API using an SDK rather than directly through a network request, you can use the `x-codeSamples` extension to add code samples to your OpenAPI document and display them in your OpenAPI pages. This property can be added to any request method and has the following schema. [​](#param-lang)langstringrequiredThe language of the code sample. [​](#param-label)labelstringThe label for the sample. This is useful when providing multiple examples for a single endpoint. [​](#param-source)sourcestringrequiredThe source code of the sample. Here is an example of code samples for a plant tracking app, which has both a Bash CLI tool and a JavaScript SDK.

```
paths:
  /plants:
    get:
      # ...
      x-codeSamples:
        - lang: bash
          label: List all unwatered plants
          source: |
            planter list -u
        - lang: javascript
          label: List all unwatered plants
          source: |
            const planter = require('planter');
            planter.list({ unwatered: true });
        - lang: bash
          label: List all potted plants
          source: |
            planter list -p
        - lang: javascript
          label: List all potted plants
          source: |
            const planter = require('planter');
            planter.list({ potted: true });
```

# AsyncAPI setup

> Create websocket documentation with AsyncAPI specifications.

## ​Demo

 See the [websocket playground](https://mintlify.com/docs/api-playground/websocket-playground) for an example of the AsyncAPI playground.

## ​Add an AsyncAPI specification file

 To create pages for your websockets, you must have a valid AsyncAPI schema document in either JSON or YAML format that follows the [AsyncAPI specification 3.0+](https://www.asyncapi.com/docs/reference/specification/v3.0.0). Use the [AsyncAPI Studio](https://studio.asyncapi.com/) to validate your AsyncAPI schema.

```
/your-project
  |- docs.json
  |- asyncapi.json
```

## ​Auto-populate websockets pages

 To automatically generate pages for all channels in your AsyncAPI schema, add an `asyncapi` property to any navigation element. The `asyncapi` property accepts a path to an AsyncAPI schema document in your documentation repo, a URL to a hosted AsyncAPI document, or an array of links to AsyncAPI schema documents.

### ​Examples with tabs

```
"navigation": {
  "tabs": [
    {
        "tab": "API Reference",
        "asyncapi": "/path/to/asyncapi.json"
    }
  ]
}
```

 When you specify multiple AsyncAPI files, each file generates its own set of channel pages.

### ​Examples with groups

```
"navigation": {
  "tabs": [
    {
      "tab": "AsyncAPI",
      "groups": [
        {
          "group": "Websockets",
          "asyncapi": {
            "source": "/path/to/asyncapi.json",
            "directory": "websockets"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

 The `directory` field is optional. If not specified, the files will be placed in the **api-reference** folder of the docs repo.

## ​Channel page

 If you want more control over how you order your channels or if you want to reference only specific channels, create an MDX file with the `asyncapi` property in the frontmatter.

```
---
title: "Websocket Channel"
asyncapi: "/path/to/asyncapi.json channelName"
---
```

---

# Complex data types

> Describe APIs with flexible schemas, optional properties, and multiple data formats using oneOf, anyOf, and allOf keywords.

Describe APIs with flexible schemas, optional properties, and multiple data formats using `oneOf`, `anyOf`, and `allOf` keywords.

---

# Manage page visibility

> Control which API endpoints appear in your documentation navigation.

For internal-only endpoints, deprecated operations, beta features, or endpoints that should be accessible via direct URL but not discoverable through site navigation, you can control which OpenAPI operations get published as documentation pages and their visibility in navigation. If your pages are autogenerated from an OpenAPI document, manage page visibility with the `x-hidden` and `x-excluded` extensions.

## ​x-hidden

 The `x-hidden` extension creates a page for an endpoint, but hides it from navigation. The page is only accessible by navigating directly to its URL. Common use cases for `x-hidden` are:

- Endpoints you want to document, but not promote.
- Pages that you will link to from other content.
- Endpoints for specific users.

## ​x-excluded

 The `x-excluded` extension completely excludes an endpoint from your documentation. Common use cases for `x-excluded` are:

- Internal-only endpoints.
- Deprecated endpoints that you don’t want to document.
- Beta features that are not ready for public documentation.

## ​Implementation

 Add the `x-hidden` or `x-excluded` extension under the HTTP method in your OpenAPI specification. Here are examples of how to use each property in an OpenAPI schema document for an endpoint and a webhook path. Endpoint example

```
"paths": {
  "/plants": {
    "get": {
      "description": "Returns all plants from the store",
      "parameters": { /*...*/ },
      "responses": { /*...*/ }
    }
  },
  "/hidden_plants": {
    "get": {
      "x-hidden": true,
      "description": "Returns all somewhat secret plants from the store",
      "parameters": { /*...*/ },
      "responses": { /*...*/ }
    }
  },
  "/secret_plants": {
    "get": {
      "x-excluded": true,
      "description": "Returns all top secret plants from the store (do not publish this endpoint!)",
      "parameters": { /*...*/ },
      "responses": { /*...*/ }
    }
  }
},
```

 Webhook example

```
"webhooks": {
  "/plants_hook": {
    "post": {
      "description": "Webhook for information about a new plant added to the store",
    }
  },
  "/hidden_plants_hook": {
    "post": {
      "x-hidden": true,
      "description": "Webhook for somewhat secret information about a new plant added to the store"
    }
  },
  "/secret_plants_hook": {
    "post": {
      "x-excluded": true,
      "description": "Webhook for top secret information about a new plant added to the store (do not publish this endpoint!)"
    }
  }
}
```

# Create manual API pages

> Document API endpoints manually with MDX files.

You can manually define API endpoints in individual MDX pages. This approach is useful for small APIs or prototyping.

## ​Setup

 1

Configure your API settings

In your `docs.json` file, define your base URL and authentication method.

```
"api": {
  "mdx": {
    "server": "https://mintlify.com/api",
    "auth": {
      "method": "key",
      "name": "x-api-key"
    }
  }
}
```

If you want to hide the API playground, set the `display` field to `none`. You don’t need to include an authentication method if you hide the playground.

```
"api": {
  "playground": {
    "display": "none"
  }
}
```

Find a full list of API configurations in [Settings](https://mintlify.com/docs/organize/settings#api-configurations).2

Create your endpoint pages

Create an MDX file for each endpoint. Define the `title` and `api` in the frontmatter:

```
---
title: 'Create new user'
api: 'POST https://api.mintlify.com/user'
---
```

Specify path parameters by wrapping them in `{}`:

```
https://api.example.com/v1/endpoint/{userId}
```

If you have a `server` field configured in `docs.json`, you can use relative paths like `/v1/endpoint`.To override the global playground display mode for a specific page, add `playground` to the frontmatter:

```
---
title: 'Create new user'
api: 'POST https://api.mintlify.com/user'
playground: 'none'
---
```

Options:

- `playground: 'interactive'` - Display the interactive playground (default)
- `playground: 'simple'` - Display a copyable endpoint with no playground
- `playground: 'none'` - Hide the playground entirely

3

Add parameters and responses

Use [parameter and response fields](https://mintlify.com/docs/components/fields) to document your endpoint’s parameters and return values.

```
<ParamField path="userId" type="string" required>
  Unique identifier for the user
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="email" type="string" required>
  User's email address
</ParamField>

<ResponseField name="id" type="string" required>
  Unique identifier for the newly created user
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="email" type="string" required>
  User's email address
</ResponseField>
```

4

Add your endpoints to your docs

Add your endpoint pages to the navigation by updating the `pages` field in your `docs.json`:docs.json

```
"navigation": {
  "tabs": [
    {
      "tab": "API Reference",
      "groups": [
        {
          "group": "Users",
          "pages": [
            "api-reference/users/create-user",
            "api-reference/users/get-user",
            "api-reference/users/update-user"
          ]
        },
        {
          "group": "Orders",
          "pages": [
            "api-reference/orders/create-order",
            "api-reference/orders/list-orders"
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Each page path corresponds to an MDX file in your docs repository. For example, `api-reference/users/create-user.mdx`. Learn more about structuring your docs in [Navigation](https://mintlify.com/docs/organize/navigation).

### ​Using OpenAPI endpoints in navigation

If you have an OpenAPI specification, you can reference endpoints directly in your navigation without creating individual MDX files. Reference specific endpoints by including the OpenAPI file path and the endpoint:docs.json

```
"navigation": {
  "pages": [
    "introduction",
    "/path/to/users-openapi.json POST /users",
    "/path/to/orders-openapi.json GET /orders"
  ]
}
```

You can also set a default OpenAPI spec for a navigation group and reference endpoints by method and path:docs.json

```
{
  "group": "API reference",
  "openapi": "/path/to/openapi-v1.json",
  "pages": [
    "overview",
    "authentication",
    "GET /users",
    "POST /users",
    {
      "group": "Orders",
      "openapi": "/path/to/openapi-v2.json",
      "pages": [
        "GET /orders",
        "POST /orders"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

For more details on OpenAPI integration, see [OpenAPI setup](https://mintlify.com/docs/api-playground/openapi-setup).

## ​Enable authentication

 You can set authentication globally in `docs.json` or override it on individual pages using the `authMethod` field in frontmatter. A page-specific method overrides the global setting.

### ​Bearer token

```
"api": {
  "mdx": {
    "auth": {
      "method": "bearer"
    }
  }
}
```

### ​Basic authentication

```
"api": {
  "mdx": {
    "auth": {
      "method": "basic"
    }
  }
}
```

### ​API key

```
"api": {
  "mdx": {
    "auth": {
      "method": "key",
      "name": "x-api-key"
    }
  }
}
```

### ​None

 To disable authentication on a specific page, set `authMethod` to `none`: Page Metadata

```
---
title: "Your page title"
authMethod: "none"
---
```

---

# Multiple responses

> Document multiple response variations for API endpoints.

If your API returns different responses based on input parameters, user context, or other conditions of the request, you can document multiple response examples with the `examples` property. This property can be added to any response and has the following schema.

```
responses:
  "200":
    description: Successful response
    content:
      application/json:
        schema:
          $ref: "#/components/schemas/YourResponseSchema"
        examples:
          us:
            summary: Response for United States
            value:
              countryCode: "US"
              currencyCode: "USD"
              taxRate: 0.0825
          gb:
            summary: Response for United Kingdom
            value:
              countryCode: "GB"
              currencyCode: "GBP"
              taxRate: 0.20
```

# OpenAPI setup

> Generate API pages from your OpenAPI specification automatically.

OpenAPI is a specification for describing APIs. Mintlify supports OpenAPI 3.0+ documents to generate interactive API documentation and keep it up to date.

## ​Add an OpenAPI specification file

 To document your endpoints with OpenAPI, you need one or more valid OpenAPI specifications in either JSON or YAML format that follow the [OpenAPI specification 3.0+](https://swagger.io/specification/). Add OpenAPI specifications to your documentation repository or host them online where you can access the specifications by URL. Reference any number of OpenAPI specifications in the navigation element of your `docs.json` to create pages for your API endpoints. Each specification file generates its own set of endpoints.

```
"navigation": {
  "tabs": [
    {
      "tab": "API Reference",
      "openapi": "openapi.json"
    }
  ]
}
```

 Mintlify supports `$ref` for **internal references only** within a single OpenAPI document. External references are not supported.

### ​Describe your API

 We recommend the following resources to learn about and construct your OpenAPI specification.

- [Swagger’s OpenAPI Guide](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/v3_0/basic-structure/) to learn the OpenAPI syntax.
- [The OpenAPI specification Markdown sources](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/main/versions/) to reference details of the latest OpenAPI specification.
- [Swagger Editor](https://editor.swagger.io/) to edit, validate, and debug your OpenAPI document.
- [The Mint CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mint) to validate your OpenAPI document with the command: `mint openapi-check <openapiFilenameOrUrl>`.

 Swagger’s OpenAPI Guide is for OpenAPI v3.0, but nearly all of the information is applicable to v3.1. For more information on the differences between v3.0 and v3.1, see [Migrating from OpenAPI 3.0 to 3.1.0](https://www.openapis.org/blog/2021/02/16/migrating-from-openapi-3-0-to-3-1-0) in the OpenAPI blog.

### ​Specify the base URL for your API

 To enable the API playground, add a `servers` field to your OpenAPI specification with your API’s base URL.

```
{
  "servers": [
    {
      "url": "https://api.example.com/v1"
    }
  ]
}
```

 In an OpenAPI specification, different API endpoints are specified by their paths, like `/users/{id}` or simply `/`. The base URL defines where these paths should be appended. For more information on how to configure the `servers` field, see [API Server and Base Path](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/api-host-and-base-path/) in the OpenAPI documentation. The API playground uses these server URLs to determine where to send requests. If you specify multiple servers, a dropdown allows users to toggle between servers. If you do not specify a server, the API playground uses simple mode since it cannot send requests without a base URL. If your API has endpoints that exist at different URLs, you can [override theserversfield](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/v3_0/api-host-and-base-path/#overriding-servers) for a given path or operation.

### ​Specify authentication

 To enable authentication in your API documentation and playground, configure the `securitySchemes` and `security` fields in your OpenAPI specification. The API descriptions and API playground add authentication fields based on the security configurations in your OpenAPI specification. 1

Define your authentication method.

Add a `securitySchemes` field to define how users authenticate.This example shows a configuration for bearer authentication.

```
{
  "components": {
    "securitySchemes": {
      "bearerAuth": {
        "type": "http",
        "scheme": "bearer"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

2

Apply authentication to your endpoints.

Add a `security` field to require authentication.

```
{
  "security": [
    {
      "bearerAuth": []
    }
  ]
}
```

 Common authentication types include:

- [API Keys](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/authentication/api-keys/): For header, query, or cookie-based keys.
- [Bearer](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/authentication/bearer-authentication/): For JWT or OAuth tokens.
- [Basic](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/authentication/basic-authentication/): For username and password.

 If different endpoints within your API require different methods of authentication, you can [override thesecurityfield](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/authentication/#:~:text=you%20can%20apply%20them%20to%20the%20whole%20API%20or%20individual%20operations%20by%20adding%20the%20security%20section%20on%20the%20root%20level%20or%20operation%20level%2C%20respectively.) for a given operation. For more information on defining and applying authentication, see [Authentication](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/authentication/) in the OpenAPI documentation.

## ​Customize your endpoint pages

 Customize your endpoint pages by adding the `x-mint` extension to your OpenAPI specification. The `x-mint` extension provides additional control over how your API documentation is generated and displayed.

### ​Metadata

 Override the default metadata for generated API pages by adding `x-mint: metadata` to any operation. You can use any metadata field that would be valid in MDX frontmatter except for `openapi`.

```
{
  "paths": {
    "/users": {
      "get": {
        "summary": "Get users",
        "description": "Retrieve a list of users",
        "x-mint": {
          "metadata": {
            "title": "List all users",
            "description": "Fetch paginated user data with filtering options",
            "og:title": "Display a list of users"
          }
        },
        "parameters": [
          {
            // Parameter configuration
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### ​Content

 Add content before the auto-generated API documentation using `x-mint: content`. The `x-mint: content` extension supports all Mintlify MDX components and formatting.

```
{
  "paths": {
    "/users": {
      "post": {
        "summary": "Create user",
        "x-mint": {
          "content": "## Prerequisites\n\nThis endpoint requires admin privileges and has rate limiting.\n\n<Note>User emails must be unique across the system.</Note>"
        },
        "parameters": [
          {
            // Parameter configuration
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### ​Href

 Change the URL of the endpoint page in your docs using `x-mint: href`. When `x-mint: href` is present, the navigation entry links directly to the specified URL instead of generating an API page.

```
{
  "paths": {
    "/legacy-endpoint": {
      "get": {
        "summary": "Legacy endpoint",
        "x-mint": {
          "href": "/deprecated-endpoints/legacy-endpoint"
        }
      }
    },
    "/documented-elsewhere": {
      "post": {
        "summary": "Special endpoint",
        "x-mint": {
          "href": "/guides/special-endpoint-guide"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## ​Auto-populate API pages

 Add an `openapi` field to any navigation element in your `docs.json` to automatically generate pages for OpenAPI endpoints. You can control where these pages appear in your navigation structure, as dedicated API sections or with other pages. The `openapi` field accepts either a file path in your docs repo or a URL to a hosted OpenAPI document. Generated endpoint pages have these default metadata values:

- `title`: The operation’s `summary` field, if present. If there is no `summary`, the title is generated from the HTTP method and endpoint.
- `description`: The operation’s `description` field, if present.
- `version`: The `version` value from the parent anchor or tab, if present.
- `deprecated`: The operation’s `deprecated` field. If `true`, a deprecated label appears next to the endpoint title in the side navigation and on the endpoint page.

 To exclude specific endpoints from your auto-generated API pages, add the [x-hidden](https://mintlify.com/docs/api-playground/managing-page-visibility#x-hidden) property to the operation in your OpenAPI spec. There are two approaches for adding endpoint pages into your documentation:

1. **Dedicated API sections**: Reference OpenAPI specs in navigation elements for dedicated API sections.
2. **Selective endpoints**: Reference specific endpoints in your navigation alongside other pages.

### ​Dedicated API sections

 Generate dedicated API sections by adding an `openapi` field to a navigation element and no other pages. All endpoints in the specification are included.

```
"navigation": {
  "tabs": [
    {
        "tab": "API Reference",
        "openapi": "https://petstore3.swagger.io/api/v3/openapi.json"
    }
  ]
}
```

 To organize multiple OpenAPI specifications in separate sections of your documentation, assign each specification to a different group in your navigation hierarchy. Each group can reference its own OpenAPI specification.

```
"navigation": {
  "tabs": [
    {
      "tab": "API Reference",
      "groups": [
        {
          "group": "Users API",
          "openapi": {
            "source": "/path/to/users-openapi.json",
            "directory": "users-api-reference"
          }
        },
        {
          "group": "Admin API",
          "openapi": {
            "source": "/path/to/admin-openapi.json",
            "directory": "admin-api-reference"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

 The `directory` field is optional and specifies where generated API pages are stored in your docs repo. If not specified, defaults to the `api-reference` directory of your repo.

### ​Selective endpoints

 When you want more control over where endpoints appear in your documentation, you can reference specific endpoints in your navigation. This approach allows you to generate pages for API endpoints alongside other content. You can also use this approach to mix endpoints from different OpenAPI specifications.

#### ​Set a default OpenAPI spec

 Configure a default OpenAPI specification for a navigation element. Then reference specific endpoints in the `pages` field.

```
"navigation": {
  "tabs": [
    {
      "tab": "Getting started",
      "pages": [
        "quickstart",
        "installation"
      ]
    },
    {
      "tab": "API reference",
      "openapi": "/path/to/openapi.json",
      "pages": [
        "api-overview",
        "GET /users",
        "POST /users",
        "guides/authentication"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

 Any page entry matching the format `METHOD /path` generates an API page for that endpoint using the default OpenAPI specification.

#### ​OpenAPI spec inheritance

 OpenAPI specifications are inherited down the navigation hierarchy. Child navigation elements inherit their parent’s OpenAPI specification unless they define their own.

```
{
  "group": "API reference",
  "openapi": "/path/to/openapi-v1.json",
  "pages": [
    "overview",
    "authentication",
    "GET /users",
    "POST /users",
    {
      "group": "Orders",
      "openapi": "/path/to/openapi-v2.json",
      "pages": [
        "GET /orders",
        "POST /orders"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

#### ​Individual endpoints

 Reference specific endpoints without setting a default OpenAPI specification by including the file path. You can reference endpoints from multiple OpenAPI specifications in the same documentation section.

```
"navigation": {
  "pages": [
    "introduction",
    "user-guides",
    "/path/to/users-openapi.json POST /users",
    "/path/to/orders-openapi.json GET /orders"
  ]
}
```

 This approach is useful when you need individual endpoints from different specifications, only want to include select endpoints, or want to include endpoints alongside other types of documentation.

## ​Create MDX pages from your OpenAPI specification

 For more granular control over individual endpoint pages, create MDX pages from your OpenAPI specification. This lets you customize page metadata, content, and reorder or exclude pages in your navigation while still using the auto-generated parameters and responses. There are two ways to document your OpenAPI specification with individual MDX pages:

- Document endpoints with the `openapi` field in the frontmatter.
- Document data models with the `openapi-schema` field in the frontmatter.

### ​Document endpoints

 Create a page for each endpoint and specify which OpenAPI operation to display using the `openapi` field in the frontmatter.

```
---
title: "Get users"
description: "Returns all plants from the system that the user has access to"
openapi: "/path/to/openapi-1.json GET /users"
deprecated: true
version: "1.0"
---
```

 The method and path must exactly match your OpenAPI spec. If you have multiple OpenAPI specifications, include the file path in your reference. External OpenAPI URLs can be referenced in `docs.json`.

#### ​Autogenerate endpoint pages

 To autogenerate MDX files from your OpenAPI specification, use the Mintlify [scraper](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@mintlify/scraping).

```
npx @mintlify/scraping@latest openapi-file <path-to-openapi-file> -o <folder-name>
```

 Add the `-o` flag to specify a folder to populate the files into. If a folder is not specified, the files will populate in the working directory.

### ​Document data models

 Create a page for each data structure defined in your OpenAPI specification’s `components.schemas` using the `openapi-schema` field in the frontmatter.

```
---
openapi-schema: OrderItem
---
```

 If you have schemas with the same name in multiple files, specify the OpenAPI file:

```
---
openapi-schema: en-schema.json OrderItem
---
```

## ​Webhooks

 Webhooks are HTTP callbacks that your API sends to notify external systems when events occur. Webhooks are supported in OpenAPI 3.1+ documents. Add a `webhooks` field to your OpenAPI document alongside the `paths` field. For more information on defining webhooks, see [Webhooks](https://spec.openapis.org/oas/v3.1.0#oasWebhooks) in the OpenAPI documentation. To create an MDX page for a webhook (OpenAPI 3.1+), use `webhook` instead of an HTTP method:

```
---
title: "Order updated webhook"
description: "Triggered when an order is updated"
openapi: "openapi.json webhook orderUpdated"
---
```

 The webhook name must exactly match the key in your OpenAPI spec’s `webhooks` field.

# Playground

> Let developers test API endpoints directly in your documentation.

## ​Overview

 The API playground is an interactive environment that lets users test and explore your API endpoints. Developers can craft API requests, submit them, and view responses without leaving your documentation. See [Trigger an update](https://mintlify.com/docs/api/update/trigger) for an example of the API playground in action. ![API playground for the trigger an update endpoint.](https://mintcdn.com/mintlify/f7fo9pnTEtzBD70_/images/playground/API-playground-light.png?fit=max&auto=format&n=f7fo9pnTEtzBD70_&q=85&s=f83551b5d84cf27a44ed1d9418ca61be)![API playground for the trigger an update endpoint.](https://mintcdn.com/mintlify/f7fo9pnTEtzBD70_/images/playground/API-playground-dark.png?fit=max&auto=format&n=f7fo9pnTEtzBD70_&q=85&s=5a0dc3fd3ca0a5766c599c00a5910dba) The playground generates interactive pages for your endpoints based on your OpenAPI specification or AsyncAPI schema. If you modify your API, the playground automatically updates the relevant pages. We recommend generating your API playground from an OpenAPI specification. However, you can manually create API reference pages after defining a base URL and authentication method in your `docs.json`.

## ​Get started

 1

Add your OpenAPI specification file.

Validate your OpenAPI specification file using the [Swagger Editor](https://editor.swagger.io/) or [Mint CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mint) command `mint openapi-check <filename>`.

```
/your-project
  |- docs.json
  |- openapi.json
```

2

Generate endpoint pages.

Update your `docs.json` to reference your OpenAPI specification.**To automatically generate pages for all endpoints in your OpenAPI specification**, add an `openapi` property to any navigation element.This example generates a page for each endpoint specified in `openapi.json` and organizes the pages in the “API reference” group.Generate all endpoint pages

```
"navigation": {
  "groups": [
    {
      "group": "API reference",
      "openapi": "openapi.json"
    }
  ]
}
```

**To generate pages for only specific endpoints**, list the endpoints in the `pages` property of the navigation element.This example generates pages for only the `GET /users` and `POST /users` endpoints. To generate other endpoint pages, add additional endpoints to the `pages` array.Generate specific endpoint pages

```
"navigation": {
  "groups": [
      {
        "group": "API reference",
        "openapi": "openapi.json",
        "pages": [
          "GET /users",
          "POST /users"
        ]
      }
  ]
}
```

## ​Customize your playground

 Customize your API playground by defining the following properties in your `docs.json`. [​](#param-playground)playgroundobjectConfigurations for the API playground.

Hide playground

[​](#param-display)display"interactive" | "simple" | "none"The display mode of the API playground.

- `"interactive"`: Display the interactive playground.
- `"simple"`: Display a copyable endpoint with no playground.
- `"none"`: Display nothing.

Defaults to `interactive`.[​](#param-proxy)proxybooleanWhether to pass API requests through a proxy server. Defaults to `true`. [​](#param-examples)examplesobjectConfigurations for the autogenerated API examples.

Hide examples

[​](#param-languages)languagesarray of stringExample languages for the autogenerated API snippets.Languages display in the order specified.[​](#param-defaults)defaults"required" | "all"Whether to show optional parameters in API examples. Defaults to `all`.[​](#param-prefill)prefillbooleanWhether to prefill the API playground with data from schema examples. When enabled, the playground automatically populates request fields with example values from your OpenAPI specification. Defaults to `false`.[​](#param-autogenerate)autogeneratebooleanWhether to generate code samples for endpoints from API specifications. Defaults to `true`. When set to `false`, only manually-written code samples (from `x-codeSamples` in OpenAPI specifications or `<RequestExample>` components in MDX) appear in the API playground.

### ​Example configuration

 This example configures the API playground to be interactive with example code snippets for cURL, Python, and JavaScript. Only required parameters are shown in the code snippets, and the playground prefills the request body with example values.

```
{
 "api": {
   "playground": {
     "display": "interactive"
   },
   "examples": {
     "languages": ["curl", "python", "javascript"],
     "defaults": "required",
     "prefill": true
   }
 }
}
```

### ​Custom endpoint pages

 When you need more control over your API documentation, use the `x-mint` extension in your OpenAPI specification or create individual MDX pages for your endpoints. Both options allow you to:

- Customize page metadata
- Add additional content like examples
- Control playground behavior per page

 The `x-mint` extension is recommended so that all of your API documentation is automatically generated from your OpenAPI specification and maintained in one file. Individual MDX pages are recommended for small APIs or when you want to experiment with changes on a per-page basis.

# Troubleshooting

> Resolve common issues with API page configuration.

If your API pages aren’t displaying correctly, check these common configuration issues.

All of my OpenAPI pages are completely blank

In this scenario, it’s likely that either Mintlify cannot find your OpenAPI document,
or your OpenAPI document is invalid.Running `mint dev` locally should reveal some of these issues.To verify your OpenAPI document will pass validation:

1. Visit [this validator](https://editor.swagger.io/)
2. Switch to the “Validate text” tab
3. Paste in your OpenAPI document
4. Click “Validate it!”

If the text box that appears below has a green border, your document has passed validation.
This is the exact validation package Mintlify uses to validate OpenAPI documents, so if your document
passes validation here, there’s a great chance the problem is elsewhere.Additionally, Mintlify does not support OpenAPI 2.0. If your document uses this version of the specification,
you could encounter this issue. You can convert your document at [editor.swagger.io](https://editor.swagger.io/) (under Edit > Convert to OpenAPI 3):![Screenshot of the Swagger Editor with the Edit menu expanded and the "Convert to OpenAPI 3" menu item highlighted.](https://mintcdn.com/mintlify/GiucHIlvP3i5L17o/images/convert-oas-3.png?fit=max&auto=format&n=GiucHIlvP3i5L17o&q=85&s=3a45e89b8847e632d20b0ae9b3b5d689)

One of my OpenAPI pages is completely blank

This is usually caused by a misspelled `openapi` field in the page metadata. Make sure
the HTTP method and path match the HTTP method and path in the OpenAPI document exactly.Here’s an example of how things might go wrong:get-user.mdx

```
---
openapi: "GET /users/{id}/"
---
```

openapi.yaml

```
paths:
  "/users/{id}":
    get: ...
```

Notice that the path in the `openapi` field has a trailing slash, whereas the path in the OpenAPI
document does not.Another common issue is a misspelled filename. If you are specifying a particular OpenAPI document
in the `openapi` field, ensure the filename is correct. For example, if you have two OpenAPI
documents `openapi/v1.json` and `openapi/v2.json`, your metadata might look like this:api-reference/v1/users/get-user.mdx

```
---
openapi: "v1 GET /users/{id}"
---
```

Requests from the API Playground don't work

If you have a custom domain configured, this could be an issue with your reverse proxy. By
default, requests made via the API Playground start with a `POST` request to the
`/_mintlify/api/request` path on the docs site. If your reverse proxy is configured to only allow `GET`
requests, then all of these requests will fail. To fix this, configure your reverse proxy to
allow `POST` requests to the `/_mintlify/api/request` path.Alternatively, if your reverse proxy prevents you from accepting `POST` requests, you can configure Mintlify to send requests directly to your backend with the `api.playground.proxy` setting in the `docs.json`, as described in the [settings documentation](https://mintlify.com/docs/organize/settings#param-proxy). When using this configuration, you will need to configure CORS on your server since requests will come directly from users’ browsers rather than through your proxy.

OpenAPI navigation entries are not generating pages

If you are using an OpenAPI navigation configuration, but the pages aren’t generating, check these common issues:

1. **Missing default OpenAPI spec**: Ensure you have an `openapi` field set for the navigation element:

```
"navigation": {
  "groups": [
    {
      "group": "API reference",
      "openapi": "/path/to/openapi.json",
      "pages": [
        "GET /users",
        "POST /users"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

1. **OpenAPI spec inheritance**: If using nested navigation, ensure child groups inherit the correct OpenAPI spec or specify their own.
2. **Validation issues**: Use `mint openapi-check <path-to-openapi-file>` to verify your OpenAPI document is valid.

Some OpenAPI operations appear in navigation but others don't

1. **Hidden operations**: Operations marked with `x-hidden: true` in your OpenAPI spec won’t appear in auto-generated navigation.
2. **Invalid operations**: Operations with validation errors in the OpenAPI spec may be skipped. Check your OpenAPI document for syntax errors.
3. **Manual vs automatic inclusion**: If you reference any endpoints from an OpenAPI spec, only the explicitly referenced operations will appear in navigation. No other pages will be automatically added. This includes operations that are referenced in child navigation elements.

Mixed navigation (OpenAPI and MDX pages) not working correctly

When combining OpenAPI operations with regular documentation pages in navigation:

1. **File conflicts**: You cannot have both an `MDX` file and a navigation entry for the same operation. For example, if you have `get-users.mdx`, do not also include `"GET /users"` in your navigation.  If you need to have a file that shares a name with an operation, use the `x-mint` extension for the endpoint to have the href point to a different location.
2. **Path resolution**: Navigation entries that don’t match OpenAPI operations will be treated as file paths. Ensure your `MDX` files exist at the expected locations.
3. **Case sensitivity**: OpenAPI operation matching is case-sensitive. Ensure HTTP methods are uppercase in navigation entries.
