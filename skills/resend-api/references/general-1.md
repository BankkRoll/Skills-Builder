# Security

> An overview of Resend security features and practices.

## ​Governance

 Resend establishes policies and controls, monitors compliance with those controls, and proves the security and compliance to third-party auditors. Our policies are based on the following **foundational principles**:

## Least Privilege

Access should be limited to only those with a legitimate business needs,
based on the principle of least privilege.

## Consistency

Security controls should be applied consistently across all areas of the
enterprise.

## Defense in Depth

Security controls should be implemented and layered according to the
principle of defense-in-depth.

## Continuous Improvement

The implementation of controls should be iterative, continuously improving
effectiveness and decreasing friction.

### ​Compliance Standards

SOC 2 Type II

Resend is SOC 2 Type II compliant. The audit was completed by Vanta & Advantage Partners.
You can download a copy of the report on the [Documents](https://resend.com/settings/documents) page.

GDPR

Resend is GDPR compliant. You can learn more about our [GDPR compliance](https://resend.com/security/gdpr) or view our [DPA](https://resend.com/legal/dpa).

## ​Data Protection

## Data at rest

All datastores are encrypted at rest. Sensitive collections and tables also
use row-level encryption.

## Data in transit

Resend uses TLS 1.3 or higher everywhere data is transmitted over
potentially insecure networks.

## Data backup

Resend backs-up all production data using a point-in-time approach. Backups
are persisted for 30 days, and are globally replicated for resiliency
against regional disasters.

## ​Product Security

### ​Penetration testing

 Resend engages with third-party firms to conduct penetration testing at least annually. All areas of the Resend product and cloud infrastructure are in-scope for these assessments, and source code is fully available to the testers in order to maximize the effectiveness and coverage. You can download the latest penetration test report on the [Documents](https://resend.com/settings/documents) page.

### ​Vulnerability scanning

 Resend uses multiple vulnerability monitoring techniques including code-level scanning, dependency scanning, and security reviews to identify and remediate vulnerabilities. Vulnerabilities are prioritized based on severity and risk, and are remediated according to the following schedule:

- Critical: 15 Days
- High: 30 Days
- Medium: 90 Day
- Low: 180 Days
- Informational: As needed

## ​Enterprise Security

## Endpoint protection

All company devices are equipped with anti-malware protection. Endpoint security alerts are monitored with 24/7/365 coverage. We use MDM software to enforce secure configuration of endpoints, such as disk encryption, screen lock configuration, and software updates.

## Security education

Resend provides comprehensive security training to all employees upon onboarding and annually.Resend’s conducts threat briefings with employees to inform them of important security and safety-related updates that require special attention or action.

## Identity and access management

Resend employees are granted access to applications based on their role, and automatically deprovisioned upon termination of their employment. Further access must be approved according to the policies set for each application.Multi-factor authentication is required for all employees to access company applications.

## ​Responsible Disclosure

 To report a vulnerability, please check the guidelines on the [Responsible Disclosure](https://resend.com/security/responsible-disclosure) page.

# Send emails with Astro

> Learn how to send your first email using Astro, Resend, and Node.js.

## ​Prerequisites

 To get the most out of this guide, you’ll need to:

- [Create an API key](https://resend.com/api-keys)
- [Verify your domain](https://resend.com/domains)

 If you prefer to watch a video, check out our video walkthrough below.

## ​1. Install

 Install Resend for Node.js.

```
npm install resend
```

## ​2. Install an SSR adapter

 Because Astro builds a static site by default, [install an SSR adapter](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/server-side-rendering/) to enable on-demand rendering of routes.

## ​3. Add your API key

 [Create an API key](https://resend.com/api-keys) in Resend and add it to your `.env` file to keep your API key secret. .env

```
RESEND_API_KEY="re_xxxxxxxxx"
```

## ​4. Send email using HTML

 Create an [Astro Action](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/actions/) under `actions/index.ts`. The easiest way to send an email is with the `html` parameter.

```
import { ActionError, defineAction } from 'astro:actions';
import { Resend } from 'resend';

const resend = new Resend(import.meta.env.RESEND_API_KEY);

export const server = {
  send: defineAction({
    accept: 'form',
    handler: async () => {
      const { data, error } = await resend.emails.send({
        from: 'Acme <[email protected]>',
        to: ['[email protected]'],
        subject: 'Hello world',
        html: '<strong>It works!</strong>',
      });

      if (error) {
        throw new ActionError({
          code: 'BAD_REQUEST',
          message: error.message,
        });
      }

      return data;
    },
  }),
};
```

 Call the `send` action from any frontmatter route, script, or component.

# Send emails using Auth0 with SMTP

> Learn how to integrate Auth0 with Resend SMTP.

## ​Prerequisites

 To get the most out of this guide, you’ll need to:

- [Create an API key](https://resend.com/api-keys)
- [Verify your domain](https://resend.com/domains)

## ​1. Get the Resend SMTP credentials

 When configuring your SMTP integration, you’ll need to use the following credentials:

- **Host**: `smtp.resend.com`
- **Port**: `465` or `587` (see [port options](#port-options) below)
- **Username**: `resend`
- **Password**: `YOUR_API_KEY`

### ​Port options

 Resend supports multiple ports for different security configurations:

| Type | Port | Security |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SMTPS | 465,2465 | Implicit SSL/TLS (Immediately connects via SSL/TLS) |
| STARTTLS | 25,587,2587 | Explicit SSL/TLS (First connects via plaintext, then upgrades to SSL/TLS) |

 For Auth0, we recommend using port `465` (SMTPS) or `587` (STARTTLS).

## ​2. Integrate with Auth0 SMTP

 After logging into your [Auth0](https://auth0.com/) dashboard, you’ll need to enable the SMTP integration.

1. From your Auth0 dashboard, go to [Branding > Email Provider](https://manage.auth0.com/#/templates/provider).
2. Enable the **Use my own email provider** toggle.
3. Select **SMTP Provider**.
4. Enter a **From** email address, and then enter the Resend SMTP server’s **Host**, **Port**, **Username**, and your API key as the **Password**.

 ![Auth0 SMTP - Email Provider Settings](https://mintcdn.com/resend/ABWmVTZIHGIFNTFD/images/auth0-smtp.png?fit=max&auto=format&n=ABWmVTZIHGIFNTFD&q=85&s=91d6c2472ae892f200787d35a3568533)

## ​3. Send a test email

 Once you have configured the SMTP settings, click **Save**. Next send a test email using the **Send Test Email** button. If everything is configured correctly, you will receive a confirmation email. If you did not receive an email, check your [Auth0 Logs](https://manage.auth0.com/#/logs).

# Send emails using Django with SMTP

> Learn how to integrate Django with Resend SMTP.

## ​Prerequisites

 To get the most out of this guide, you’ll need to:

- [Create an API key](https://resend.com/api-keys)
- [Verify your domain](https://resend.com/domains)
- Install `virtualenv` by running `pip install virtualenv`

## ​1. Setup your environment

 Create and activate your new virtualenv.

```
virtualenv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

 Install dependencies.

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

 Set your `RESEND_API_KEY` environment variable by running.

```
export RESEND_API_KEY="re_xxxxxxxxx"
```

## ​2. Send email using Django’s SMTP EmailMessage

 Set the necessary attributes in your `settings.py` file.

```
EMAIL_BACKEND = 'django.core.mail.backends.smtp.EmailBackend'
RESEND_SMTP_PORT = 587
RESEND_SMTP_USERNAME = 'resend'
RESEND_SMTP_HOST = 'smtp.resend.com'
```

 Use Django’s `get_connection` and `EmailMessage`

```
import os
from django.conf import settings
from django.http import JsonResponse
from django.core.mail import EmailMessage, get_connection

# Sample Django view
def index(request):

    subject = "Hello from Django SMTP"
    recipient_list = ["[email protected]"]
    from_email = "[email protected]"
    message = "<strong>it works!</strong>"

    with get_connection(
        host=settings.RESEND_SMTP_HOST,
        port=settings.RESEND_SMTP_PORT,
        username=settings.RESEND_SMTP_USERNAME,
        password=os.environ["RESEND_API_KEY"],
        use_tls=True,
        ) as connection:
            r = EmailMessage(
                  subject=subject,
                  body=message,
                  to=recipient_list,
                  from_email=from_email,
                  connection=connection).send()
    return JsonResponse({"status": "ok"})
```

# Send emails with Django

> Learn how to send your first email using Django and the Resend Python SDK.

## ​Prerequisites

 To get the most out of this guide, you’ll need to:

- [Create an API key](https://resend.com/api-keys)
- [Verify your domain](https://resend.com/domains)

## ​1. Install

 Get the [django-anymail](https://anymail.dev/en/stable/esps/resend/) package with Resend support.

```
pip install django-anymail[resend]
```

## ​2. Configure

 Add Anymail to your Django settings. settings.py

```
import os

INSTALLED_APPS = [
    # ...
    "anymail",
]

EMAIL_BACKEND = "anymail.backends.resend.EmailBackend"
ANYMAIL = {
    "RESEND_API_KEY": os.environ.get("RESEND_API_KEY"),
}
DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL = "[email protected]"
```

## ​3. Send email using HTML

 The easiest way to send an email is by using the `html_message` parameter. views.py

```
from django.core.mail import send_mail
from django.http import JsonResponse

def send_email(request):
    send_mail(
        subject="Hello from Django + Resend",
        message="This is a plain text message.",
        from_email="Acme <[email protected]>",
        recipient_list=["[email protected]"],
        html_message="<strong>it works!</strong>",
    )

    return JsonResponse({"message": "Email sent successfully"})
```

## ​4. Send email using a template

 For more complex emails, you can use Django’s template system. First, create an HTML template at `templates/emails/welcome.html`: templates/emails/welcome.html

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <title>Welcome Email</title>
  </head>
  <body style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
    <h1>Welcome, {{ user_name }}!</h1>
    <p>Thank you for joining our service.</p>
    <p>Your account email: <strong>{{ user_email }}</strong></p>
    <p>
      <a
        href="{{ dashboard_url }}"
        style="background-color: #007bff; color: white; padding: 10px 20px; text-decoration: none; border-radius: 5px;"
      >
        Go to Dashboard
      </a>
    </p>
  </body>
</html>
```

 Then render and send the template: views.py

```
from django.core.mail import EmailMessage
from django.http import JsonResponse
from django.template.loader import render_to_string

def send_template_email(request):
    html_content = render_to_string('emails/welcome.html', {
        'user_name': 'Django Developer',
        'user_email': '[email protected]',
        'dashboard_url': 'https://example.com/dashboard',
    })

    message = EmailMessage(
        subject="Welcome to Our Service!",
        body=html_content,
        from_email="Acme <[email protected]>",
        to=["[email protected]"],
    )
    message.content_subtype = "html"
    message.send()

    return JsonResponse({"message": "Email sent successfully"})
```

# Send emails using Laravel with SMTP

> Learn how to send your first email using Laravel with SMTP.

## ​Prerequisites

 To get the most out of this guide, you’ll need to:

- [Create an API key](https://resend.com/api-keys)
- [Verify your domain](https://resend.com/domains)

## ​1. Setup your environment

 First, configure your Resend SMTP details in your application’s `.env` file: .env

```
MAIL_MAILER=smtp
MAIL_HOST=smtp.resend.com
MAIL_PORT=587
MAIL_USERNAME=resend
MAIL_PASSWORD=re_xxxxxxxxx
MAIL_ENCRYPTION=tls
MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS[email protected]
MAIL_FROM_NAME=Acme
```

## ​2. Send an email

 Now you’re ready to send emails with Laravel’s powerful email service. Here’s an example of how you could send your first email using Resend SMTP: OrderShipmentController.php

```
<?php

namespace App\Http\Controllers;

use App\Http\Controllers\Controller;
use App\Mail\OrderShipped;
use App\Models\Order;
use Illuminate\Http\RedirectResponse;
use Illuminate\Http\Request;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Mail;

class OrderShipmentController extends Controller
{
    /**
     * Ship the given order.
     */
    public function store(Request $request): RedirectResponse
    {
        $order = Order::findOrFail($request->order_id);

        // Ship the order...

        Mail::to($request->user())->send(new OrderShipped($order));

        return redirect('/orders');
    }
}
```

# Send emails with Laravel

> Learn how to send your first email using Laravel.

## ​Prerequisites

 To get the most out of this guide, you will need to:

- [Create an API key](https://resend.com/api-keys)
- [Verify your domain](https://resend.com/domains)

 Prefer watching a video? Check out this video walkthrough below.

## ​1. Install

 First, install Resend for Laravel using the Composer package manager: Composer

```
composer require resend/resend-laravel
```

## ​2. Configuration

### ​API key

 Next, you should configure your Resend API key in your application’s `.env` file: .env

```
RESEND_API_KEY=re_xxxxxxxxx
```

 If you’ve upgraded your Laravel project from an older version (pre-5.5) and haven’t enabled auto service provider discovery, you’ll need to manually register the Resend service provider. Add the provider to the `providers` array in your `config/app.php` file:config/app.php

```
'providers' => [
    // ... other providers
    Resend\Laravel\ResendServiceProvider::class,
],
```

Without this registration, the Facade may reference the core Resend PHP client instead of the Resend Laravel library, causing unexpected behavior.

### ​Mail driver

 To use Resend as your mail driver, first create a new mailer definition, in the `mailers` array within your application’s `config/mail.php` configuration file: mail.php

```
'resend' => [
    'transport' => 'resend',
],
```

 Next, update your application’s `.env` file to use the Resend mail driver: .env

```
MAIL_MAILER=resend
MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS[email protected]
MAIL_FROM_NAME=Acme
```

## ​3. Send an email

 Resend for Laravel provides two convenient ways to send emails, using Laravel’s email service or the `Resend` API facade.

### ​Using the Mail Facade

 OrderShipmentController.php

```
<?php

namespace App\Http\Controllers;

use App\Http\Controllers\Controller;
use App\Mail\OrderShipped;
use App\Models\Order;
use Illuminate\Http\RedirectResponse;
use Illuminate\Http\Request;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Mail;

class OrderShipmentController extends Controller
{
    /**
     * Ship the given order.
     */
    public function store(Request $request): RedirectResponse
    {
        $order = Order::findOrFail($request->order_id);

        // Ship the order...

        Mail::to($request->user())->send(new OrderShipped($order));

        return redirect('/orders');
    }
}
```

### ​Using the Resend Facade

 OrderShipmentController.php

```
<?php

namespace App\Http\Controllers;

use App\Http\Controllers\Controller;
use App\Mail\OrderShipped;
use App\Models\Order;
use Illuminate\Http\RedirectResponse;
use Illuminate\Http\Request;
use Resend\Laravel\Facades\Resend;

class OrderShipmentController extends Controller
{
    /**
     * Ship the given order.
     */
    public function store(Request $request): RedirectResponse
    {
        $order = Order::findOrFail($request->order_id);

        // Ship the order...

        Resend::emails()->send([
            'from' => 'Acme <[email protected]>',
            'to' => [$request->user()->email],
            'subject' => 'hello world',
            'html' => (new OrderShipped($order))->render(),
        ])

        return redirect('/orders');
    }
}
```

## ​4. Receiving webhook requests

 By default, Resend for Laravel includes a webhook controller to respond to the `/resend/webhook` URL path. The controller will dispatch a Laravel event that corresponds to a Resend event. For example, an `email.delivered` event type will send an `EmailDelivered` Laravel event.

### ​Register the webhook endpoint

 Register your publicly accessible HTTPS URL in the Resend dashboard. For development, you can create a tunnel to your localhost server using a tool like
[ngrok](https://ngrok.com/download) or [VS Code Port Forwarding](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/debugtest/port-forwarding). These tools serve your local dev environment at a public URL you can use to test your local webhook endpoint.Example: `https://example123.ngrok.io/api/webhook` ![Add Webhook](https://mintcdn.com/resend/OWNnQaVDyqcGyhhN/images/laravel-create-webhook.png?fit=max&auto=format&n=OWNnQaVDyqcGyhhN&q=85&s=f551f634ded549840bc894726ca3483b)

### ​CSRF protection

 Webhook requests from Resend need to bypass Laravel’s CSRF protection. Be sure to list the URI as an exception in your application’s `App\Http\Middleware\VerifyCsrfToken` middleware or list the route outside of the web middleware group:

```
protected $except = [
    'resend/*',
];
```

### ​Verifying webhook signatures

 To enable webhook verification, ensure that the `RESEND_WEBHOOK_SECRET` environment variable is set in your application’s `.env` file. The **Signing secret** can be retrieved from your [Resend dashboard](https://resend.com/webhooks).

```
import { EmailTemplate } from '../../../components/email-template';
import { Resend } from 'resend';

const resend = new Resend(process.env.RESEND_API_KEY);

export async function POST() {
  try {
    const { data, error } = await resend.emails.send({
