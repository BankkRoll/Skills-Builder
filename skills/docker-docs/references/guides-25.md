## Prerequisites

Complete the previous sections of this guide, starting with [Develop your Rust application](https://docs.docker.com/guides/rust/develop/). You must have a [GitHub](https://github.com/signup) account and a verified [Docker](https://hub.docker.com/signup) account to complete this section.

## Overview

In this section, you'll learn how to set up and use GitHub Actions to build and push your Docker image to Docker Hub. You will complete the following steps:

1. Create a new repository on GitHub.
2. Define the GitHub Actions workflow.
3. Run the workflow.

## Step one: Create the repository

Create a GitHub repository, configure the Docker Hub credentials, and push your source code.

1. [Create a new repository](https://github.com/new) on GitHub.
2. Open the repository **Settings**, and go to **Secrets and variables** >
  **Actions**.
3. Create a new **Repository variable** named `DOCKER_USERNAME` and your Docker ID as a value.
4. Create a new
  [Personal Access Token (PAT)](https://docs.docker.com/security/access-tokens/#create-an-access-token) for Docker Hub. You can name this token `docker-tutorial`. Make sure access permissions include Read and Write.
5. Add the PAT as a **Repository secret** in your GitHub repository, with the name
  `DOCKERHUB_TOKEN`.
6. In your local repository on your machine, run the following command to change
  the origin to the repository you just created. Make sure you change
  `your-username` to your GitHub username and `your-repository` to the name of
  the repository you created.
  ```console
  $ git remote set-url origin https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
  ```
7. Run the following commands to stage, commit, and push your local repository to GitHub.
  ```console
  $ git add -A
  $ git commit -m "my commit"
  $ git push -u origin main
  ```

## Step two: Set up the workflow

Set up your GitHub Actions workflow for building, testing, and pushing the image
to Docker Hub.

1. Go to your repository on GitHub and then select the **Actions** tab.
2. Select **set up a workflow yourself**.
  This takes you to a page for creating a new GitHub actions workflow file in
  your repository, under `.github/workflows/main.yml` by default.
3. In the editor window, copy and paste the following YAML configuration.
  ```yaml
  name: ci
  on:
    push:
      branches:
        - main
  jobs:
    build:
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      steps:
        - name: Login to Docker Hub
          uses: docker/login-action@v3
          with:
            username: ${{ vars.DOCKER_USERNAME }}
            password: ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_TOKEN }}
        - name: Set up Docker Buildx
          uses: docker/setup-buildx-action@v3
        - name: Build and push
          uses: docker/build-push-action@v6
          with:
            push: true
            tags: ${{ vars.DOCKER_USERNAME }}/${{ github.event.repository.name }}:latest
  ```
  For more information about the YAML syntax for `docker/build-push-action`,
  refer to the [GitHub Action README](https://github.com/docker/build-push-action/blob/master/README.md).

## Step three: Run the workflow

Save the workflow file and run the job.

1. Select **Commit changes...** and push the changes to the `main` branch.
  After pushing the commit, the workflow starts automatically.
2. Go to the **Actions** tab. It displays the workflow.
  Selecting the workflow shows you the breakdown of all the steps.
3. When the workflow is complete, go to your
  [repositories on Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/repositories).
  If you see the new repository in that list, it means the GitHub Actions
  successfully pushed the image to Docker Hub.

## Create a Kubernetes YAML file

In your `docker-rust-postgres` directory, create a file named
`docker-rust-kubernetes.yaml`. Open the file in an IDE or text editor and add
the following contents. Replace `DOCKER_USERNAME/REPO_NAME` with your Docker
username and the name of the repository that you created in [Configure CI/CD for
your Rust application](https://docs.docker.com/guides/rust/configure-ci-cd/).

```yaml

            ]
      containers:

              protocol: TCP
          env:
            - name: ADDRESS
              value: 0.0.0.0:8000

      port: 5432
      targetPort: 5432
  selector:
    service: db
status:
  loadBalancer: {}
```

In this Kubernetes YAML file, there are four objects, separated by the `---`. In addition to a Service and Deployment for the database, the other two objects are:

- A Deployment, describing a scalable group of identical pods. In this case,
  you'll get just one replica, or copy of your pod. That pod, which is
  described under `template`, has just one container in it. The container is
  created from the image built by GitHub Actions in [Configure CI/CD for your
  Rust application](https://docs.docker.com/guides/rust/configure-ci-cd/).
- A NodePort service, which will route traffic from port 30001 on your host to
  port 5000 inside the pods it routes to, allowing you to reach your app
  from the network.

To learn more about Kubernetes objects, see the [Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/home/).

## Deploy and check your application

1. In a terminal, navigate to `docker-rust-postgres` and deploy your application
  to Kubernetes.
  ```console
  $ kubectl apply -f docker-rust-kubernetes.yaml
  ```
  You should see output that looks like the following, indicating your Kubernetes objects were created successfully.
  ```shell
  deployment.apps/server created
  deployment.apps/db created
  service/server created
  service/db created
  ```
2. Make sure everything worked by listing your deployments.
  ```console
  $ kubectl get deployments
  ```
  Your deployment should be listed as follows:
  ```shell
  NAME                 READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
  db       1/1     1            1           2m21s
  server   1/1     1            1           2m21s
  ```
  This indicates all of the pods you asked for in your YAML are up and running. Do the same check for your services.
  ```console
  $ kubectl get services
  ```
  You should get output like the following.
  ```shell
  NAME         TYPE        CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)          AGE
  db           ClusterIP   10.105.167.81    <none>        5432/TCP         109s
  kubernetes   ClusterIP   10.96.0.1        <none>        443/TCP          9d
  server       NodePort    10.101.235.213   <none>        5000:30001/TCP   109s
  ```
  In addition to the default `kubernetes` service, you can see your `service-entrypoint` service, accepting traffic on port 30001/TCP.
3. In a terminal, curl the service.
  ```console
  $ curl http://localhost:30001/users
  [{"id":1,"login":"root"}]
  ```
4. Run the following command to tear down your application.
  ```console
  $ kubectl delete -f docker-rust-kubernetes.yaml
  ```

## Prerequisites

- You have installed the latest version of
  [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/).
- You have completed the walkthroughs in the Docker Desktop
  [Learning Center](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/use-desktop/) to learn about Docker concepts.
- You have a [git client](https://git-scm.com/downloads). The examples in this section use a command-line based git client, but you can use any client.

## Overview

In this section, you’ll learn how to use volumes and networking in Docker. You’ll also use Docker to build your images and Docker Compose to make everything a whole lot easier.

First, you’ll take a look at running a database in a container and how you can use volumes and networking to persist your data and let your application talk with the database. Then you’ll pull everything together into a Compose file which lets you set up and run a local development environment with one command.

## Run a database in a container

Instead of downloading PostgreSQL, installing, configuring, and then running the PostgreSQL database as a service, you can use the Docker Official Image for PostgreSQL and run it in a container.

Before you run PostgreSQL in a container, create a volume that Docker can manage to store your persistent data and configuration. Use the named volumes feature that Docker provides instead of using bind mounts.

Run the following command to create your volume.

```console
$ docker volume create db-data
```

Now create a network that your application and database will use to talk to each other. The network is called a user-defined bridge network and gives you a nice DNS lookup service which you can use when creating your connection string.

```console
$ docker network create postgresnet
```

Now you can run PostgreSQL in a container and attach to the volume and network that you created previously. Docker pulls the image from Hub and runs it for you locally.
In the following command, option `--mount` is for starting the container with a volume. For more information, see
[Docker volumes](https://docs.docker.com/engine/storage/volumes/).

```console
$ docker run --rm -d --mount \
  "type=volume,src=db-data,target=/var/lib/postgresql" \
  -p 5432:5432 \
  --network postgresnet \
  --name db \
  -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=mysecretpassword \
  -e POSTGRES_DB=example \
  postgres:18
```

Now, make sure that your PostgreSQL database is running and that you can connect to it. Connect to the running PostgreSQL database inside the container.

```console
$ docker exec -it db psql -U postgres
```

You should see output like the following.

```console
psql (15.3 (Debian 15.3-1.pgdg110+1))
Type "help" for help.

postgres=#
```

In the previous command, you logged in to the PostgreSQL database by passing the `psql` command to the `db` container. Press ctrl-d to exit the PostgreSQL interactive terminal.

## Get and run the sample application

For the sample application, you'll use a variation of the backend from the react-rust-postgres application from [Awesome Compose](https://github.com/docker/awesome-compose/tree/master/react-rust-postgres).

1. Clone the sample application repository using the following command.
  ```console
  $ git clone https://github.com/docker/docker-rust-postgres
  ```
2. In the cloned repository's directory, run `docker init` to create the necessary Docker files. Refer to the following example to answer the prompts from `docker init`.
  ```console
  $ docker init
  Welcome to the Docker Init CLI!
  This utility will walk you through creating the following files with sensible defaults for your project:
    - .dockerignore
    - Dockerfile
    - compose.yaml
    - README.Docker.md
  Let's get started!
  ? What application platform does your project use? Rust
  ? What version of Rust do you want to use? 1.70.0
  ? What port does your server listen on? 8000
  ```
3. In the cloned repository's directory, open the `Dockerfile` in an IDE or text editor to update it.
  `docker init` handled creating most of the instructions in the Dockerfile, but you'll need to update it for your unique application. In addition to a `src` directory, this application includes a `migrations` directory to initialize the database. Add a bind mount for the `migrations` directory to the build stage in the Dockerfile. The following is the updated Dockerfile.
  ```dockerfile
  # syntax=docker/dockerfile:1
  # Comments are provided throughout this file to help you get started.
  # If you need more help, visit the Dockerfile reference guide at
  # https://docs.docker.com/reference/dockerfile/

  # What the container should run when it is started.
  CMD ["/bin/server"]
  ```
4. In the cloned repository's directory, run `docker build` to build the image.
  ```console
  $ docker build -t rust-backend-image .
  ```
5. Run `docker run` with the following options to run the image as a container on the same network as the database.
  ```console
  $ docker run \
    --rm -d \
    --network postgresnet \
    --name docker-develop-rust-container \
    -p 3001:8000 \
    -e PG_DBNAME=example \
    -e PG_HOST=db \
    -e PG_USER=postgres \
    -e PG_PASSWORD=mysecretpassword \
    -e ADDRESS=0.0.0.0:8000 \
    -e RUST_LOG=debug \
    rust-backend-image
  ```
6. Curl the application to verify that it connects to the database.
  ```console
  $ curl http://localhost:3001/users
  ```
  You should get a response like the following.
  ```json
  [{ "id": 1, "login": "root" }]
  ```

## Use Compose to develop locally

When you run `docker init`, in addition to a `Dockerfile`, it also creates a `compose.yaml` file.

This Compose file is super convenient as you don't have to type all the parameters to pass to the `docker run` command. You can declaratively do that using a Compose file.

In the cloned repository's directory, open the `compose.yaml` file in an IDE or text editor. `docker init` handled creating most of the instructions, but you'll need to update it for your unique application.

You need to update the following items in the `compose.yaml` file:

- Uncomment all of the database instructions.
- Add the environment variables under the server service.

The following is the updated `compose.yaml` file.

```yaml
# Comments are provided throughout this file to help you get started.
# If you need more help, visit the Docker compose reference guide at
# https://docs.docker.com/reference/compose-file/

# Here the instructions define your application as a service called "server".
# This service is built from the Dockerfile in the current directory.
# You can add other services your application may depend on here, such as a
# database or a cache. For examples, see the Awesome Compose repository:
# https://github.com/docker/awesome-compose
services:
  server:
    build:
      context: .
      target: final
    ports:
      - 8000:8000
    environment:
      - PG_DBNAME=example
      - PG_HOST=db
      - PG_USER=postgres
      - PG_PASSWORD=mysecretpassword
      - ADDRESS=0.0.0.0:8000
      - RUST_LOG=debug
    # The commented out section below is an example of how to define a PostgreSQL
    # database that your application can use. `depends_on` tells Docker Compose to
    # start the database before your application. The `db-data` volume persists the
    # database data between container restarts. The `db-password` secret is used
    # to set the database password. You must create `db/password.txt` and add
    # a password of your choosing to it before running `docker compose up`.
    depends_on:
      db:
        condition: service_healthy
  db:
    image: postgres:18
    restart: always
    user: postgres
    secrets:
      - db-password
    volumes:
      - db-data:/var/lib/postgresql
    environment:
      - POSTGRES_DB=example
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD_FILE=/run/secrets/db-password
    expose:
      - 5432
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "pg_isready"]
      interval: 10s
      timeout: 5s
      retries: 5
volumes:
  db-data:
secrets:
  db-password:
    file: db/password.txt
```

Note that the file doesn't specify a network for those 2 services. When you use Compose, it automatically creates a network and connects the services to it. For more information see
[Networking in Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/how-tos/networking/).

Before you run the application using Compose, notice that this Compose file specifies a `password.txt` file to hold the database's password. You must create this file as it's not included in the source repository.

In the cloned repository's directory, create a new directory named `db` and inside that directory create a file named `password.txt` that contains the password for the database. Using your favorite IDE or text editor, add the following contents to the `password.txt` file.

```text
mysecretpassword
```

If you have any other containers running from the previous sections, [stop](https://docs.docker.com/guides/rust/run-containers/#stop-start-and-name-containers) them now.

Now, run the following `docker compose up` command to start your application.

```console
$ docker compose up --build
```

The command passes the `--build` flag so Docker will compile your image and then start the containers.

Now test your API endpoint. Open a new terminal then make a request to the server using the curl commands:

```console
$ curl http://localhost:8000/users
```

You should receive the following response:

```json
[{ "id": 1, "login": "root" }]
```

## Prerequisite

You have completed [Build your Rust image](https://docs.docker.com/guides/rust/build-images/) and you have built an image.

## Overview

A container is a normal operating system process except that Docker isolates this process so that it has its own file system, its own networking, and its own isolated process tree separate from the host.

To run an image inside of a container, you use the `docker run` command. The `docker run` command requires one parameter which is the name of the image.

## Run an image

Use `docker run` to run the image you built in [Build your Rust image](https://docs.docker.com/guides/rust/build-images/).

```console
$ docker run docker-rust-image-dhi
```

After running this command, you’ll notice that you weren't returned to the command prompt. This is because your application is a server that runs in a loop waiting for incoming requests without returning control back to the OS until you stop the container.

Open a new terminal then make a request to the server using the `curl` command.

```console
$ curl http://localhost:8000
```

You should see output like the following.

```console
curl: (7) Failed to connect to localhost port 8000 after 2236 ms: Couldn't connect to server
```

As you can see, your `curl` command failed. This means you weren't able to connect to the localhost on port 8000. This is normal because your container is running in isolation which includes networking. Stop the container and restart with port 8000 published on your local network.

To stop the container, press ctrl-c. This will return you to the terminal prompt.

To publish a port for your container, you’ll use the `--publish` flag (`-p` for short) on the `docker run` command. The format of the `--publish` command is `[host port]:[container port]`. So, if you wanted to expose port 8000 inside the container to port 3001 outside the container, you would pass `3001:8000` to the `--publish` flag.

You didn't specify a port when running the application in the container and the default is 8000. If you want your previous request going to port 8000 to work, you can map the host's port 3001 to the container's port 8000:

```console
$ docker run --publish 3001:8000 docker-rust-image-dhi
```

Now, rerun the curl command. Remember to open a new terminal.

```console
$ curl http://localhost:3001
```

You should see output like the following.

```console
Hello, Docker!
```

Success! You were able to connect to the application running inside of your container on port 8000. Switch back to the terminal where your container is running and stop it.

Press ctrl-c to stop the container.

## Run in detached mode

This is great so far, but your sample application is a web server and you don't have to be connected to the container. Docker can run your container in detached mode or in the background. To do this, you can use the `--detach` or `-d` for short. Docker starts your container the same as before but this time will "detach" from the container and return you to the terminal prompt.

```console
$ docker run -d -p 3001:8000 docker-rust-image-dhi
3e4830e7f01304811d97dd3469d47a0c7a916a8b6c28ce0ef19c6f689a521144
```

Docker started your container in the background and printed the Container ID on the terminal.

Again, make sure that your container is running properly. Run the curl command again.

```console
$ curl http://localhost:3001
```

You should see output like the following.

```console
Hello, Docker!
```

## List containers

Since you ran your container in the background, how do you know if your container is running or what other containers are running on your machine? Well, to see a list of containers running on your machine, run `docker ps`. This is similar to how you use the ps command in Linux to see a list of processes.

You should see output like the following.

```console
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                   COMMAND                  CREATED          STATUS          PORTS                                         NAMES
3e4830e7f013   docker-rust-image-dhi   "/server"                23 seconds ago   Up 22 seconds   0.0.0.0:3001->8000/tcp, [::]:3001->8000/tcp   youthful_lamport
```

The `docker ps` command provides a bunch of information about your running containers. You can see the container ID, the image running inside the container, the command that was used to start the container, when it was created, the status, ports that were exposed, and the name of the container.

You are probably wondering where the name of your container is coming from. Since you didn’t provide a name for the container when you started it, Docker generated a random name. You’ll fix this in a minute, but first you need to stop the container. To stop the container, run the `docker stop` command which does just that, stops the container. You need to pass the name of the container or you can use the container ID.

```console
$ docker stop youthful_lamport
youthful_lamport
```

Now, rerun the `docker ps` command to see a list of running containers.

```console
$ docker ps
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS              PORTS               NAMES
```

## Stop, start, and name containers

You can start, stop, and restart Docker containers. When you stop a container, it's not removed, but the status is changed to stopped and the process inside the container is stopped. When you ran the `docker ps` command in the previous module, the default output only shows running containers. When you pass the `--all` or `-a` for short, you see all containers on your machine, irrespective of their start or stop status.

```console
$ docker ps -a
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                   COMMAND                  CREATED              STATUS                          PORTS                                         NAMES
3e4830e7f013   docker-rust-image-dhi   "/server"                About a minute ago   Exited (0) 28 seconds ago                                                     youthful_lamport
60009b7eaf40   docker-rust-image-dhi   "/server"                2 minutes ago        Exited (0) About a minute ago                                                 sharp_noyce
152e1d7d9eea   docker-rust-image-dhi   "/server ."              4 minutes ago        Exited (0) 2 minutes ago                                                      magical_bhabha
```

You should now see several containers listed. These are containers that you started and stopped but you haven't removed.

Restart the container that you just stopped. Locate the name of the container you just stopped and replace the name of the container in following restart command.

```console
$ docker restart youthful_lamport
```

Now list all the containers again using the `docker ps --all` command.

```console
$ docker ps --all
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                   COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS                         PORTS                                         NAMES
3e4830e7f013   docker-rust-image-dhi   "/server"                3 minutes ago       Up 7 seconds                   0.0.0.0:3001->8000/tcp, [::]:3001->8000/tcp   youthful_lamport
60009b7eaf40   docker-rust-image-dhi   "/server"                4 minutes ago       Exited (0) 3 minutes ago                                                     sharp_noyce
152e1d7d9eea   docker-rust-image-dhi   "/server ."              5 minutes ago       Exited (0) 4 minutes ago                                                     magical_bhabha
```

Notice that the container you just restarted has been started in detached mode. Also, observe the status of the container is "Up X seconds". When you restart a container, it starts with the same flags or commands that it was originally started with.

Now, stop and remove all of your containers and take a look at fixing the random naming issue. Stop the container you just started. Find the name of your running container and replace the name in the following command with the name of the container on your system.

```console
$ docker stop youthful_lamport
youthful_lamport
```

Now that you have stopped all of your containers, remove them. When you remove a container, it's no longer running, nor is it in the stopped status, but the process inside the container has been stopped and the metadata for the container has been removed.

To remove a container, run the `docker rm` command with the container name. You can pass multiple container names to the command using a single command. Again, replace the container names in the following command with the container names from your system.

```console
$ docker rm youthful_lamport friendly_montalcini tender_bose
youthful_lamport
sharp_noyce
magical_bhabha
```

Run the `docker ps --all` command again to see that Docker removed all containers.

Now, it's time to address the random naming issue. Standard practice is to name your containers for the simple reason that it's easier to identify what's running in the container and what application or service it's associated with.

To name a container, you just need to pass the `--name` flag to the `docker run` command.

```console
$ docker run -d -p 3001:8000 --name docker-rust-container docker-rust-image-dhi
1aa5d46418a68705c81782a58456a4ccdb56a309cb5e6bd399478d01eaa5cdda
$ docker ps
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                   COMMAND                  CREATED         STATUS         PORTS                                         NAMES
219b2e3c7c38   docker-rust-image-dhi   "/server"                6 seconds ago   Up 5 seconds   0.0.0.0:3001->8000/tcp, [::]:3001->8000/tcp   docker-rust-container
```

That’s better! You can now easily identify your container based on the name.
