You can upgrade or downgrade your Docker subscription at any time to match your changing needs. This page explains how to make subscription changes and what to expect with billing and feature access.

> Note
>
> Legacy Docker subscribers have different interfaces for subscription changes. Legacy subscriptions apply to subscribers who last purchased or renewed before December 10, 2024. For details, see [Announcing Upgraded Docker Plans](https://www.docker.com/blog/november-2024-updated-plans-announcement/).

## Upgrade your subscription

When you upgrade your Docker subscription, you immediately get access to all features and entitlements in your new subscription tier. For detailed feature information, see [Docker Pricing](https://www.docker.com/pricing).

To upgrade your subscription:

1. Sign in to [Docker Home](https://app.docker.com/) and select the organization
  you want to upgrade.
2. Select **Billing**.
3. Optional. If you're upgrading from a free Personal subscription to a Team subscription and want to keep your username, [convert your user account into an organization](https://docs.docker.com/admin/organization/convert-account/).
4. Select **Upgrade**.
5. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete your upgrade.

> Note
>
> If you choose to pay using a US bank account, you must verify the account. For
> more information, see [Verify a bank account](https://docs.docker.com/billing/payment-method/#verify-a-bank-account).

To upgrade your legacy Docker subscription to a new Docker subscription that includes access to all tools, contact [Docker sales](https://www.docker.com/pricing/contact-sales/).

## Downgrade your subscription

You can downgrade your Docker subscription at any time before the renewal date. The unused portion isn't refundable, but you retain access to paid features until the next billing cycle.

### Downgrade considerations

Consider the following before downgrading:

- Team size and repositories: You may need to reduce team members and convert private repositories to public or delete them based on your new subscription limits.
- SSO and SCIM: If downgrading from Docker Business and your organization uses single sign-on, remove your SSO connection and verified domains first. Organization members who were auto-provisioned through SCIM need to reset their passwords to sign in without SSO.
- Private repository collaborators: Personal subscriptions don't include collaborators for private repositories. When downgrading from Pro to Personal, all collaborators are removed and additional private repositories are locked.

For feature limits in each tier, see [Docker Pricing](https://www.docker.com/pricing).

> Important
>
> If you have a sales-assisted Docker Business subscription, contact your account manager to downgrade your subscription.

To downgrade your subscription:

1. Sign in to [Docker Home](https://app.docker.com/) and select
  the organization you want to downgrade.
2. Select **Billing**.
3. Select the action icon and then **Cancel subscription**.
4. Fill out the feedback survey to continue with cancellation.

> Important
>
> If you have a sales-assisted Docker Business subscription, contact your account manager to downgrade your subscription.

To downgrade your legacy Docker subscription:

1. Sign in to [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/billing).
2. Select the organization you want to downgrade, then select **Billing**.
3. To downgrade, you must navigate to the upgrade plan page. Select **Upgrade**.
4. On the upgrade page, select **Downgrade** in the **Free Team** plan card.
5. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete your downgrade.

To downgrade your Docker Build Cloud subscription:

1. Sign in to [Docker Home](https://app.docker.com) and select **Build Cloud**.
2. Select **Account settings**, then **Downgrade**.
3. To confirm your downgrade, type **DOWNGRADE** in the text field and select **Yes, continue**.
4. The account settings page will update with a notification bar notifying you of your downgrade date (start of next billing cycle).

## Subscription pause policy

You can't pause or delay a subscription. If a subscription invoice isn't paid by the due date, there's a 15-day grace period starting from the due date.

# Scale your subscription

> Scale Docker Build Cloud and Testcontainers Cloud consumption for your subscription

# Scale your subscription

   Table of contents

---

Docker subscriptions let you scale consumption as your needs grow. All paid Docker subscriptions include base amounts of Docker Build Cloud build minutes and Testcontainers Cloud runtime minutes that you can supplement with additional capacity.
You can scale consumption for:

- Docker Build Cloud build minutes
- Testcontainers Cloud runtime minutes

To understand your usage patterns, [view your consumption](https://docs.docker.com/admin/organization/manage-products/#view-docker-product-usage) at any time.

> Note
>
> Legacy Docker subscribers must upgrade to new Docker subscriptions to access scaling options. Legacy subscriptions apply to subscribers who last purchased or renewed before December 10, 2024. For details, see [Announcing Upgraded Docker Plans](https://www.docker.com/blog/november-2024-updated-plans-announcement/).

## Usage considerations

Minutes don't roll over. Base subscription minutes reset each billing period and don't accumulate. Additional purchased minutes expire at the end of your subscription period.

For example, with an annual Docker Team subscription (500 included minutes), if you purchase 500 additional minutes, only the additional 500 minutes roll over until your annual renewal.

## Add Docker Build Cloud build minutes

Purchase additional build minutes through the Docker Build Cloud Dashboard:

1. Sign in to [Docker Home](https://app.docker.com/) and choose
  your organization.
2. Select **Build Cloud**, then **Build minutes**.
3. Select **Add prepaid minutes**.
4. Select your additional minute amount, then **Continue to payment**.
5. Enter your payment details and billing address.
6. Review your order and select **Pay**.

Your additional minutes appear on the Build minutes page immediately.

## Add Docker Testcontainers Cloud runtime minutes

You can add Testcontainers Cloud runtime minutes in two ways:

- [Contact sales](https://www.docker.com/pricing/contact-sales/) to pre-purchase runtime minutes at discounted rates
- Use unlimited runtime minutes on-demand with billing at the end of each monthly cycle

On-demand usage is billed at higher rates than pre-purchased capacity. To avoid higher on-demand charges, pre-purchase additional minutes if you expect consistent usage over your subscription's included minutes.

Docker subscriptions provide features and benefits for individual developers, teams, and enterprise businesses. This page explains how to set up subscriptions for personal accounts and organizations.

Before you begin, make sure you have a [Docker ID](https://docs.docker.com/accounts/create-account/). To learn more about what's included with each tier, see [Docker Pricing](https://www.docker.com/pricing/).

## Set up a Docker subscription for a personal account

When you [create your Docker ID](https://docs.docker.com/accounts/create-account/), you automatically get a Docker Personal subscription. This subscription includes essential Docker tools at no cost. If you want to continue with Docker Personal, no further action is needed. You can start using Docker Desktop, Docker Hub, and other tools immediately.

If you need additional features like Docker Build Cloud minutes and more Docker Scout repositories, see [Upgrade your subscription](https://docs.docker.com/subscription/change/#upgrade-your-subscription).

## Set up a Docker subscription for an organization

You can subscribe a new or existing organization to Docker Team or Business subscriptions. Only organization owners can manage billing for the organization.

1. [Create your Docker ID](https://docs.docker.com/accounts/create-account/) if you don't already have one.
2. [Create your organization](https://docs.docker.com/admin/organization/orgs/) or use an existing organization you own.
3. Choose and purchase a Docker Team or Business subscription for the organization.

To upgrade an existing organization's subscription, see [Upgrade your subscription](https://docs.docker.com/subscription/change/#upgrade-your-subscription).
