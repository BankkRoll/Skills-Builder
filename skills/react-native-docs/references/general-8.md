If you want to try it out, please [enable the Canary Channel](https://reactnative.dev/docs/releases/release-levels) in your app.

The global [IntersectionObserver](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IntersectionObserver) interface, as defined in Web specifications. It provides a way to asynchronously observe changes in the intersection of a target element with an ancestor element or with a top-level document's viewport.

---

# Reference

## Constructor​

### IntersectionObserver()​

See [documentation in MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IntersectionObserver/IntersectionObserver).

Creates a new `IntersectionObserver` object which will execute a specified callback function when it detects that a target element's visibility has crossed one or more `threshold` or `rnRootThreshold` values.

 ts

```
new IntersectionObserver(callback, options?)
```

#### Parameters​

**callback**

A function which is called when the percentage of the target element is visible crosses a threshold. The callback receives two parameters:

- `entries`: An array of [IntersectionObserverEntry](https://reactnative.dev/docs/global-intersectionobserverentry) objects, each representing one threshold which was crossed, either becoming more or less visible than the percentage specified by that threshold.
- `observer`: The `IntersectionObserver` instance which invoked the callback.

**options** (optional)

An optional object with the following properties:

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| root | Element| null | An element that is an ancestor of the target, whose bounding rectangle will be considered the viewport. Defaults to the root viewport if not specified or ifnull. |
| rootMargin | string | A string which specifies a set of offsets to add to the root's bounding box when calculating intersections. Defaults to"0px 0px 0px 0px". |
| threshold | number | number[] | Either a single number or an array of numbers between 0.0 and 1.0, specifying a ratio of intersection area to total bounding box area for the observed target. Defaults to[0]ifrnRootThresholdis not set. |
| rnRootThreshold⚠️ | number | number[] | React Native specific.Either a single number or an array of numbers between 0.0 and 1.0, specifying a ratio of intersection area to the total root area. |

## Instance properties​

### root​

See [documentation in MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IntersectionObserver/root).

The element or document whose bounds are used as the bounding box when testing for intersection.

### rootMargin​

See [documentation in MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IntersectionObserver/rootMargin).

An offset rectangle applied to the root's bounding box when calculating intersections.

### rnRootThresholds⚠️​

 Non-standard

This is a React Native specific extension.

A list of root thresholds, sorted in increasing numeric order, where each threshold is a ratio of intersection area to bounding box area of the specified root view, which defaults to the viewport.

Notifications for a target are generated when any of the thresholds specified in `rnRootThresholds` or `thresholds` are crossed for that target.

 ts

```
get rnRootThresholds(): ReadonlyArray<number> | null;
```

### thresholds​

See [documentation in MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IntersectionObserver/thresholds).

A list of thresholds, sorted in increasing numeric order, where each threshold is a ratio of intersection area to bounding box area of an observed target.

Notifications for a target are generated when any of the thresholds specified in `rnRootThresholds` or `thresholds` are crossed for that target.

## Instance methods​

### disconnect()​

See [documentation in MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IntersectionObserver/disconnect).

Stops the `IntersectionObserver` object from observing any target.

### observe()​

See [documentation in MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IntersectionObserver/observe).

Tells the `IntersectionObserver` to begin observing a target element.

### takeRecords()​

See [documentation in MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IntersectionObserver/takeRecords).

Returns an array of `IntersectionObserverEntry` objects for all observed targets.

### unobserve()​

See [documentation in MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IntersectionObserver/unobserve).

Tells the `IntersectionObserver` to stop observing a particular target element.

# IntersectionObserverEntry 🧪

> The IntersectionObserverEntry interface, as defined in Web specifications. It describes the intersection between the target element and its root container at a specific moment of transition.

Canary 🧪

**This API is currently only available in React Native’s Canary and Experimental channels.**

If you want to try it out, please [enable the Canary Channel](https://reactnative.dev/docs/releases/release-levels) in your app.

The [IntersectionObserverEntry](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IntersectionObserverEntry) interface, as defined in Web specifications. It describes the intersection between the target element and its root container at a specific moment of transition.

Instances of `IntersectionObserverEntry` are delivered to an [IntersectionObserver](https://reactnative.dev/docs/global-intersectionobserver) callback in its `entries` parameter.

---

# Reference

## Instance properties​

### boundingClientRect​

See [documentation in MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IntersectionObserverEntry/boundingClientRect).

Returns the bounds rectangle of the target element as a `DOMRectReadOnly`.

### intersectionRatio​

See [documentation in MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IntersectionObserverEntry/intersectionRatio).

Returns the ratio of the `intersectionRect` to the `boundingClientRect`.

### intersectionRect​

See [documentation in MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IntersectionObserverEntry/intersectionRect).

Returns a `DOMRectReadOnly` representing the target's visible area.

### isIntersecting​

See [documentation in MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IntersectionObserverEntry/isIntersecting).

A Boolean value which is `true` if the target element intersects with the intersection observer's root. If this is `true`, then the `IntersectionObserverEntry` describes a transition into a state of intersection; if it's `false`, then you know the transition is from intersecting to not-intersecting.

### rnRootIntersectionRatio⚠️​

 Non-standard

This is a React Native specific extension.

Returns the ratio of the `intersectionRect` to the `rootBounds`.

 ts

```
get rnRootIntersectionRatio(): number;
```

This is analogous to `intersectionRatio`, but computed relative to the root's bounding box instead of the target's bounding box. This corresponds to the `rnRootThreshold` option and allows you to determine what percentage of the root area is covered by the target element.

### rootBounds​

See [documentation in MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IntersectionObserverEntry/rootBounds).

Returns a `DOMRectReadOnly` for the intersection observer's root.

### target​

See [documentation in MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IntersectionObserverEntry/target).

The `Element` whose intersection with the root changed.

### time​

See [documentation in MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IntersectionObserverEntry/time).

A `DOMHighResTimeStamp` indicating the time at which the intersection was recorded, relative to the `IntersectionObserver`'s time origin.

# Handling Text Input

> TextInput is a Core Component that allows the user to enter text. It has an onChangeText prop that takes a function to be called every time the text changed, and an onSubmitEditing prop that takes a function to be called when the text is submitted.

[TextInput](https://reactnative.dev/docs/textinput#content) is a [Core Component](https://reactnative.dev/docs/intro-react-native-components) that allows the user to enter text. It has an `onChangeText` prop that takes a function to be called every time the text changed, and an `onSubmitEditing` prop that takes a function to be called when the text is submitted.

For example, let's say that as the user types, you're translating their words into a different language. In this new language, every single word is written the same way: 🍕. So the sentence "Hello there Bob" would be translated as "🍕 🍕 🍕".

In this example, we store `text` in the state, because it changes over time.

There are a lot more things you might want to do with a text input. For example, you could validate the text inside while the user types. For more detailed examples, see the [React docs on controlled components](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/components/input#controlling-an-input-with-a-state-variable), or the [reference docs for TextInput](https://reactnative.dev/docs/textinput).

A `TextInput` is one of many ways for the user to interact with your app. For examples of other ways to handle input, see the documentation on [how to handle touches](https://reactnative.dev/docs/handling-touches).

Now, let's take a look at [ScrollView](https://reactnative.dev/docs/using-a-scrollview), another Core Component.

# Handling Touches

> Users interact with mobile apps mainly through touch. They can use a combination of gestures, such as tapping on a button, scrolling a list, or zooming on a map. React Native provides components to handle all sorts of common gestures, as well as a comprehensive gesture responder system to allow for more advanced gesture recognition, but the one component you will most likely be interested in is the basic Button.

Users interact with mobile apps mainly through touch. They can use a combination of gestures, such as tapping on a button, scrolling a list, or zooming on a map. React Native provides components to handle all sorts of common gestures, as well as a comprehensive [gesture responder system](https://reactnative.dev/docs/gesture-responder-system) to allow for more advanced gesture recognition, but the one component you will most likely be interested in is the basic Button.

## Displaying a basic button​

[Button](https://reactnative.dev/docs/button) provides a basic button component that is rendered nicely on all platforms. The minimal example to display a button looks like this:

 tsx

```
<Button  onPress={() => {    console.log('You tapped the button!');  }}  title="Press Me"/>
```

This will render a blue label on iOS, and a blue rounded rectangle with light text on Android. Pressing the button will call the "onPress" function, which in this case displays an alert popup. If you like, you can specify a "color" prop to change the color of your button.

![image](https://reactnative.dev/assets/images/Button-b053d1b4ecdc78a87ce72711549ba2ca.png)

Go ahead and play around with the `Button` component using the example below. You can select which platform your app is previewed in by clicking on the toggle in the bottom right and then clicking on "Tap to Play" to preview the app.

## Touchables​

If the basic button doesn't look right for your app, you can build your own button using any of the "Touchable" components provided by React Native. These components provide the capability to capture tapping gestures and can display feedback when a gesture is recognized. However, these components do not provide any default styling, so you will need to do a bit of work to get them looking nice in your app.

Which "Touchable" component you use will depend on what kind of feedback you want to provide:

- Generally, you can use [TouchableHighlight](https://reactnative.dev/docs/touchablehighlight) anywhere you would use a button or link on web. The view's background will be darkened when the user presses down on the button.
- You may consider using [TouchableNativeFeedback](https://reactnative.dev/docs/touchablenativefeedback) on Android to display ink surface reaction ripples that respond to the user's touch.
- [TouchableOpacity](https://reactnative.dev/docs/touchableopacity) can be used to provide feedback by reducing the opacity of the button, allowing the background to be seen through while the user is pressing down.
- If you need to handle a tap gesture but you don't want any feedback to be displayed, use [TouchableWithoutFeedback](https://reactnative.dev/docs/touchablewithoutfeedback).

In some cases, you may want to detect when a user presses and holds a view for a set amount of time. These long presses can be handled by passing a function to the `onLongPress` props of any of the "Touchable" components.

Let's see all of these in action:

## Scrolling and swiping​

Gestures commonly used on devices with touchable screens include swipes and pans. These allow the user to scroll through a list of items, or swipe through pages of content. For these, check out the [ScrollView](https://reactnative.dev/docs/scrollview) Core Component.

## Known issues​

- [react-native#29308](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/29308#issuecomment-792864162): The touch area never extends past the parent view bounds and on Android negative margin is not supported.

# Headless JS

> Headless JS is a way to run tasks in JavaScript while your app is in the background. It can be used, for example, to sync fresh data, handle push notifications, or play music.

Headless JS is a way to run tasks in JavaScript while your app is in the background. It can be used, for example, to sync fresh data, handle push notifications, or play music.

## The JS API​

A task is an async function that you register on `AppRegistry`, similar to registering React applications:

 tsx

```
import {AppRegistry} from 'react-native';AppRegistry.registerHeadlessTask('SomeTaskName', () =>  require('SomeTaskName'),);
```

Then, in `SomeTaskName.js`:

 tsx

```
module.exports = async taskData => {  // do stuff};
```

You can do anything in your task such as network requests, timers and so on, as long as it doesn't touch UI. Once your task completes (i.e. the promise is resolved), React Native will go into "paused" mode (unless there are other tasks running, or there is a foreground app).

## The Platform API​

Yes, this does still require some native code, but it's pretty thin. You need to extend `HeadlessJsTaskService` and override `getTaskConfig`, e.g.:

java

```
package com.your_application_name;import android.content.Intent;import android.os.Bundle;import com.facebook.react.HeadlessJsTaskService;import com.facebook.react.bridge.Arguments;import com.facebook.react.jstasks.HeadlessJsTaskConfig;import javax.annotation.Nullable;public class MyTaskService extends HeadlessJsTaskService {  @Override  protected @Nullable HeadlessJsTaskConfig getTaskConfig(Intent intent) {    Bundle extras = intent.getExtras();    if (extras != null) {      return new HeadlessJsTaskConfig(          "SomeTaskName",          Arguments.fromBundle(extras),          5000, // timeout in milliseconds for the task          false // optional: defines whether or not the task is allowed in foreground. Default is false        );    }    return null;  }}
```

kotlin

```
package com.your_application_name;import android.content.Intentimport com.facebook.react.HeadlessJsTaskServiceimport com.facebook.react.bridge.Argumentsimport com.facebook.react.jstasks.HeadlessJsTaskConfigclass MyTaskService : HeadlessJsTaskService() {    override fun getTaskConfig(intent: Intent?): HeadlessJsTaskConfig? {        return intent.extras?.let {            HeadlessJsTaskConfig(                "SomeTaskName",                Arguments.fromBundle(it),                5000, // timeout for the task                false // optional: defines whether or not the task is allowed in foreground.                // Default is false            )        }    }}
```

Then add the service to your `AndroidManifest.xml` file inside the `application` tag:

 xml

```
<service android:name="com.example.MyTaskService" />
```

Now, whenever you [start your service](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Context.html#startService(android.content.Intent)), e.g. as a periodic task or in response to some system event / broadcast, JS will spin up, run your task, then spin down.

Example:

java

```
Intent service = new Intent(getApplicationContext(), MyTaskService.class);Bundle bundle = new Bundle();bundle.putString("foo", "bar");service.putExtras(bundle);getApplicationContext().startForegroundService(service);
```

kotlin

```
val service = Intent(applicationContext, MyTaskService::class.java)val bundle = Bundle()bundle.putString("foo", "bar")service.putExtras(bundle)applicationContext.startForegroundService(service)
```

## Retries​

By default, the headless JS task will not perform any retries. In order to do so, you need to create a `HeadlessJsRetryPolicy` and throw a specific `Error`.

`LinearCountingRetryPolicy` is an implementation of `HeadlessJsRetryPolicy` that allows you to specify a maximum number of retries with a fixed delay between each attempt. If that does not suit your needs then you can implement your own `HeadlessJsRetryPolicy`. These policies can be passed as an extra argument to the `HeadlessJsTaskConfig` constructor, e.g.

java

```
HeadlessJsRetryPolicy retryPolicy = new LinearCountingRetryPolicy(  3, // Max number of retry attempts  1000 // Delay between each retry attempt);return new HeadlessJsTaskConfig(  'SomeTaskName',  Arguments.fromBundle(extras),  5000,  false,  retryPolicy);
```

kotlin

```
val retryPolicy: HeadlessJsTaskRetryPolicy =    LinearCountingRetryPolicy(        3, // Max number of retry attempts        1000 // Delay between each retry attempt    )return HeadlessJsTaskConfig("SomeTaskName", Arguments.fromBundle(extras), 5000, false, retryPolicy)
```

A retry attempt will only be made when a specific `Error` is thrown. Inside a headless JS task, you can import the error and throw it when a retry attempt is required.

Example:

 tsx

```
import {HeadlessJsTaskError} from 'HeadlessJsTask';module.exports = async taskData => {  const condition = ...;  if (!condition) {    throw new HeadlessJsTaskError();  }};
```

If you wish all errors to cause a retry attempt, you will need to catch them and throw the above error.

## Caveats​

- By default, your app will crash if you try to run a task while the app is in the foreground. This is to prevent developers from shooting themselves in the foot by doing a lot of work in a task and slowing the UI. You can pass a fourth `boolean` argument to control this behaviour.
- If you start your service from a `BroadcastReceiver`, make sure to call `HeadlessJsTaskService.acquireWakeLockNow()` before returning from `onReceive()`.

## Example Usage​

Service can be started from Java API. First you need to decide when the service should be started and implement your solution accordingly. Here is an example that reacts to network connection change.

Following lines shows part of Android manifest file for registering broadcast receiver.

 xml

```
<receiver android:name=".NetworkChangeReceiver" >  <intent-filter>    <action android:name="android.net.conn.CONNECTIVITY_CHANGE" />  </intent-filter></receiver>
```

Broadcast receiver then handles intent that was broadcasted in onReceive function. This is a great place to check whether your app is on foreground or not. If app is not on foreground we can prepare our intent to be started, with no information or additional information bundled using `putExtra` (keep in mind bundle can handle only parcelable values). In the end service is started and wakelock is acquired.

java

# Height and Width

> A component's height and width determine its size on the screen.

A component's height and width determine its size on the screen.

## Fixed Dimensions​

The general way to set the dimensions of a component is by adding a fixed `width` and `height` to style. All dimensions in React Native are unitless, and represent density-independent pixels.

Setting dimensions this way is common for components whose size should always be fixed to a number of points and not calculated based on screen size.

 caution

There is no universal mapping from points to physical units of measurement. This means that a component with fixed dimensions might not have the same physical size, across different devices and screen sizes. However, this difference is unnoticeable for most use cases.

## Flex Dimensions​

Use `flex` in a component's style to have the component expand and shrink dynamically based on available space. Normally you will use `flex: 1`, which tells a component to fill all available space, shared evenly amongst other components with the same parent. The larger the `flex` given, the higher the ratio of space a component will take compared to its siblings.

 info

A component can only expand to fill available space if its parent has dimensions greater than `0`. If a parent does not have either a fixed `width` and `height` or `flex`, the parent will have dimensions of `0` and the `flex` children will not be visible.

After you can control a component's size, the next step is to [learn how to lay it out on the screen](https://reactnative.dev/docs/flexbox).

## Percentage Dimensions​

If you want to fill a certain portion of the screen, but you *don't* want to use the `flex` layout, you *can* use **percentage values** in the component's style. Similar to flex dimensions, percentage dimensions require parent with a defined size.

# Using Hermes

> Hermes is an open-source JavaScript engine optimized for React Native. For many apps, using Hermes will result in improved start-up time, decreased memory usage, and smaller app size when compared to JavaScriptCore.

[Hermes](https://hermesengine.dev) is an open-source JavaScript engine optimized for React Native. For many apps, using Hermes will result in improved start-up time, decreased memory usage, and smaller app size when compared to JavaScriptCore.
Hermes is used by default by React Native and no additional configuration is required to enable it.

## Bundled Hermes​

React Native comes with a **bundled version** of Hermes.
We are building a version of Hermes for you whenever we release a new version of React Native. This will make sure you're consuming a version of Hermes which is fully compatible with the version of React Native you're using.

This change is fully transparent to users of React Native. You can still disable Hermes using the command described in this page.
You can [read more about the technical implementation on this page](https://reactnative.dev/architecture/bundled-hermes).

## Confirming Hermes is in use​

If you've recently created a new app from scratch, you should see if Hermes is enabled in the welcome view:

 ![Where to find JS engine status in the new project?](https://reactnative.dev/docs/assets/HermesApp.png)

A `HermesInternal` global variable will be available in JavaScript that can be used to verify that Hermes is in use:

 jsx

```
const isHermes = () => !!global.HermesInternal;
```

 caution

If you are using a non-standard way of loading the JS bundle, it is possible that the `HermesInternal` variable is available but you aren't using the highly optimised pre-compiled bytecode.
Confirm that you are using the `.hbc` file and also benchmark the before/after as detailed below.

To see the benefits of Hermes, try making a release build/deployment of your app to compare. For example; from the root of your project:

shell

```
npm run android -- --mode="release"
```

shell

```
yarn android --mode release
```

shell

```
npm run ios -- --mode="Release"
```

shell

```
yarn ios --mode Release
```

This will compile JavaScript to Hermes Bytecode during build time which will improve your app's startup speed on device.

## Switching back to JavaScriptCore​

React Native also supports using JavaScriptCore as the [JavaScript engine](https://reactnative.dev/docs/javascript-environment). Follow the instructions [from the community repository](https://github.com/react-native-community/javascriptcore) to opt-out of Hermes.
