# Migrate to Mintlify

> Learn how to migrate to Mintlify from Docusaurus, ReadMe, or another platform.

This guide helps you move your existing documentation to Mintlify. Choose automated migration for supported platforms or manual migration for complete control over the process.

## ​Choose your migration path

## Automated migration

If you are migrating from Docusaurus or ReadMe, use our tools to automate your migration.

## Manual migration

If you are migrating from any other platform, follow our guide to migrate your content.

- Automated migration
- Manual migration

Migrate your documentation using the [@mintlify/scraping package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@mintlify/scraping). The package scrapes your content and converts it to use Mintlify components.

### ​Supported Platforms

## Docusaurus

## ReadMe

If your documentation is hosted on another platform, see the manual migration steps.

### ​Installing the scraper

Install the `@mintlify/scraping` package to get started.

```
npm install @mintlify/scraping@latest -g
```

### ​Scraping pages and sections

The migration tool automatically detects your documentation platform and converts your content. Prepared files are stored locally in `./docs` by default.For large documentation sites, migrate smaller sections at a time rather than the entire site at once.**Migrate entire sections:**

```
mintlify-scrape section https://your-docs-site.com/docs
```

**Migrate single pages:**

```
mintlify-scrape page https://your-docs-site.com/docs/getting-started
```

**Migrate OpenAPI specifications:**

```
mintlify-scrape openapi-file [openApiFilename]
```

### ​Add prepared content to your Mintlify project

After scraping your existing documentation platform, you are ready to build your docs on Mintlify.Confirm that all of your pages have been migrated then add these files to the documentation repository that you created during the onboarding process. This is usually a GitHub repository.Migrate your documentation from any platform with full control over the process.

### ​Content migration

To migrate your content to Mintlify, you will need:

- A valid `docs.json` for your site settings and navigation. See [Global settings](https://mintlify.com/docs/organize/settings) and [Navigation](https://mintlify.com/docs/organize/navigation) for more information.
- A Markdown file (`.md` or `.mdx`) for each page of your documentation. MDX is the recommended format. See [Pages](https://mintlify.com/docs/organize/pages) for more information.
- (Optional) An OpenAPI specification for your API endpoint pages. See [OpenAPI setup](https://mintlify.com/docs/api-playground/openapi-setup) for more information.

1. If your content is already in Markdown format, copy the content to your Mintlify project. Otherwise, convert your content to MDX format.
2. Create your `docs.json` referencing the paths to your Markdown pages.
3. If you have OpenAPI specifications, add them to your `docs.json` and configure the API playground.

If you migrate your content as `.md` files, convert them to `.mdx` to support interactive features like React components.

### ​Asset migration

1. Copy assets to your repository’s `images/` directory.
2. Update references in your Markdown files:
  ```
  ![Alt text](/images/screenshot.png)
  ```

## ​Post-migration checklist

 After completing your migration (automated or manual), we recommend checking:

- All pages render
- Navigation works as intended
- Internal links resolve properly
- Images and assets load correctly
- Code blocks display with proper syntax highlighting
- Search functionality works
- Deployment is configured
- Custom domain is set up

---

# Navigation

> Design information architecture that aligns with user needs.

The [navigation](https://mintlify.com/docs/organize/settings#param-navigation) property in `docs.json` controls the structure and information hierarchy of your documentation. With proper navigation configuration, you can organize your content so that users can find exactly what they’re looking for. Choose one primary organizational pattern at the root level of your navigation. Once you’ve chosen your primary pattern, you can nest other navigation elements within it.

## ​Pages

 Pages are the most fundamental navigation component. Each page is an MDX file in your documentation repository. ![Decorative graphic of pages.](https://mintcdn.com/mintlify/Y6rP0BmbzgwHuEoU/images/navigation/pages-light.png?fit=max&auto=format&n=Y6rP0BmbzgwHuEoU&q=85&s=d9531be8cc28553992a6513ff09fc6ed) ![Decorative graphic of pages.](https://mintcdn.com/mintlify/Y6rP0BmbzgwHuEoU/images/navigation/pages-dark.png?fit=max&auto=format&n=Y6rP0BmbzgwHuEoU&q=85&s=ec51691241465e13d49afafcd30748f8) In the `navigation` object, `pages` is an array where each entry must reference the path to a [page file](https://mintlify.com/docs/organize/pages).

```
{
  "navigation": {
    "pages": [
      "settings",
      "pages",
      "navigation",
      "themes",
      "custom-domain"
    ]
  }
}
```

## ​Groups

 Use groups to organize your sidebar navigation into sections. Groups can be nested within each other, labeled with tags, and styled with icons. ![Decorative graphic of groups.](https://mintcdn.com/mintlify/Y6rP0BmbzgwHuEoU/images/navigation/groups-light.png?fit=max&auto=format&n=Y6rP0BmbzgwHuEoU&q=85&s=393243b71cd60407c0ea883359592699) ![Decorative graphic of groups.](https://mintcdn.com/mintlify/Y6rP0BmbzgwHuEoU/images/navigation/groups-dark.png?fit=max&auto=format&n=Y6rP0BmbzgwHuEoU&q=85&s=834d116249fcd1484808f1a534ea2892) In the `navigation` object, `groups` is an array where each entry is an object that requires a `group` field and a `pages` field. The `icon`, `tag`, and `expanded` fields are optional.

```
{
  "navigation": {
    "groups": [
      {
        "group": "Getting started",
        "icon": "play",
        "pages": [
          "quickstart",
          {
            "group": "Editing",
            "expanded": false,
            "icon": "pencil",
            "pages": [
              "installation",
              "editor"
            ]
          }
        ]
      },
      {
        "group": "Writing content",
        "icon": "notebook-text",
        "tag": "NEW",
        "pages": [
          "writing-content/page",
          "writing-content/text"
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}

### ​Default expanded state

 Use the `expanded` property to control the default state of a nested group in the navigation sidebar.

- `expanded: true`: Group is expanded by default.
- `expanded: false` or omitted: Group is collapsed by default.

 The `expanded` property only affects nested groups—groups within groups. Top-level groups are always expanded and cannot be collapsed.

```
{
  "group": "Getting started",
  "pages": [
    "quickstart",
    {
      "group": "Advanced",
      "expanded": false,
      "pages": ["installation", "configuration"]
    }
  ]
}
```

## ​Tabs

 Tabs create distinct sections of your documentation with separate URL paths. Tabs create a horizontal navigation bar at the top of your documentation that lets users switch between sections. ![Decorative graphic of a tab navigation.](https://mintcdn.com/mintlify/Y6rP0BmbzgwHuEoU/images/navigation/tabs-light.png?fit=max&auto=format&n=Y6rP0BmbzgwHuEoU&q=85&s=aeec785d0771a3a7a87d941e318bf8e7) ![Decorative graphic of a tab navigation.](https://mintcdn.com/mintlify/Y6rP0BmbzgwHuEoU/images/navigation/tabs-dark.png?fit=max&auto=format&n=Y6rP0BmbzgwHuEoU&q=85&s=20637c7abbe07ee7b2c41c4df26d2ffd) In the `navigation` object, `tabs` is an array where each entry is an object that requires a `tab` field and can contain other navigation fields such as groups, pages, icons, or links to external pages.

```
{
  "navigation": {
    "tabs": [
      {
        "tab": "API reference",
        "icon": "square-terminal",
        "pages": [
          "api-reference/get",
          "api-reference/post",
          "api-reference/delete"
        ]
      },
      {
        "tab": "SDKs",
        "icon": "code",
        "pages": [
          "sdk/fetch",
          "sdk/create",
          "sdk/delete"
        ]
      },
      {
        "tab": "Blog",
        "icon": "newspaper",
        "href": "https://external-link.com/blog"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### ​Menus

 Menus add dropdown navigation items to a tab. Use menus to help users go directly to specific pages within a tab. In the `navigation` object, `menu` is an array where each entry is an object that requires an `item` field and can contain other navigation fields such as groups, pages, icons, or links to external pages. Menu items can only contain groups, pages, and external links.

```
{
  "navigation": {
    "tabs": [
      {
        "tab": "Developer tools",
        "icon": "square-terminal",
        "menu": [
          {
            "item": "API reference",
            "icon": "rocket",
            "groups": [
              {
                "group": "Core endpoints",
                "icon": "square-terminal",
                "pages": [
                  "api-reference/get",
                  "api-reference/post",
                  "api-reference/delete"
                ]
              }
            ]
          },
          {
            "item": "SDKs",
            "icon": "code",
            "description": "SDKs are used to interact with the API.",
            "pages": [
              "sdk/fetch",
              "sdk/create",
              "sdk/delete"
            ]
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## ​Anchors

 Anchors add persistent navigation items to the top of your sidebar. Use anchors to section your content, provide quick access to external resources, or create prominent calls to action. ![Decorative graphic of an anchor navigation.](https://mintcdn.com/mintlify/Y6rP0BmbzgwHuEoU/images/navigation/anchors-light.png?fit=max&auto=format&n=Y6rP0BmbzgwHuEoU&q=85&s=e66255f62fc5d17ca135f21f84ed9325) ![Decorative graphic of an anchor navigation.](https://mintcdn.com/mintlify/Y6rP0BmbzgwHuEoU/images/navigation/anchors-dark.png?fit=max&auto=format&n=Y6rP0BmbzgwHuEoU&q=85&s=734e33b5fd52071d6f4019b273f2a0e8) In the `navigation` object, `anchors` is an array where each entry is an object that requires an `anchor` field and can contain other navigation fields such as groups, pages, icons, or links to external pages.

```
{
  "navigation": {
    "anchors": [
      {
        "anchor": "Documentation",
        "icon": "book-open",
        "pages": [
          "quickstart",
          "development",
          "navigation"
        ]
      },
      {
        "anchor": "API reference",
        "icon": "square-terminal",
        "pages": [
          "api-reference/get",
          "api-reference/post",
          "api-reference/delete"
        ]
      },
      {
        "anchor": "Blog",
        "href": "https://external-link.com/blog"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### ​Global anchors

 Use global anchors for external links that should appear on all pages, regardless of which section of your navigation the user is viewing. Global anchors are particularly useful for linking to resources outside your documentation, such as a blog, community forum, or support portal. Global anchors must include an `href` field pointing to an external URL. They cannot contain relative paths.

```
{
  "navigation": {
    "global":  {
      "anchors": [
        {
          "anchor": "Blog",
          "icon": "pencil",
          "href": "https://mintlify.com/blog"
        }
      ]
    },
    "tabs": /*...*/
  }
}
```

## ​Dropdowns

 Dropdowns are contained in an expandable menu at the top of your sidebar navigation. Each item in a dropdown directs to a section of your documentation. ![Decorative graphic of a dropdown navigation.](https://mintcdn.com/mintlify/Y6rP0BmbzgwHuEoU/images/navigation/dropdowns-light.png?fit=max&auto=format&n=Y6rP0BmbzgwHuEoU&q=85&s=f04faa13e4a15c6866b8ceee98362018) ![Decorative graphic of a dropdown navigation.](https://mintcdn.com/mintlify/Y6rP0BmbzgwHuEoU/images/navigation/dropdowns-dark.png?fit=max&auto=format&n=Y6rP0BmbzgwHuEoU&q=85&s=4ee16248cae08fee00fe98952b599041) In the `navigation` object, `dropdowns` is an array where each entry is an object that requires a `dropdown` field and can contain other navigation fields such as groups, pages, icons, or links to external pages.

```
{
  "navigation": {
    "dropdowns": [
      {
        "dropdown": "Documentation",
        "icon": "book-open",
        "pages": [
          "quickstart",
          "development",
          "navigation"
        ]
      },
      {
        "dropdown": "API reference",
        "icon": "square-terminal",
        "pages": [
          "api-reference/get",
          "api-reference/post",
          "api-reference/delete"
        ]
      },
      {
        "dropdown": "Blog",
        "href": "https://external-link.com/blog"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## ​Products

 ![Decorative graphic of a product switcher.](https://mintcdn.com/mintlify/uTIQZECUoznwRp7Y/images/navigation/product-switcher-light.png?fit=max&auto=format&n=uTIQZECUoznwRp7Y&q=85&s=ab051b15c6e533eb2d723fed8f400704) ![Decorative graphic of a product switcher.](https://mintcdn.com/mintlify/uTIQZECUoznwRp7Y/images/navigation/product-switcher-dark.png?fit=max&auto=format&n=uTIQZECUoznwRp7Y&q=85&s=4827f6913945eeadb2c54362ee0f748d) Products create a dedicated navigation division for organizing product-specific documentation. Use products to separate different offerings, services, or major feature sets within your documentation. In the `navigation` object, `products` is an array where each entry is an object that requires a `product` field and can contain other navigation fields such as groups, pages, icons, or links to external pages.

```
{
  "navigation": {
    "products": [
      {
        "product": "Core API",
        "description": "Core API description",
        "icon": "api",
        "groups": [
          {
            "group": "Getting started",
            "pages": [
              "core-api/quickstart",
              "core-api/authentication"
            ]
          },
          {
            "group": "Endpoints",
            "pages": [
              "core-api/users",
              "core-api/orders"
            ]
          }
        ]
      },
      {
        "product": "Analytics Platform",
        "description": "Analytics Platform description",
        "icon": "chart-bar",
        "pages": [
          "analytics/overview",
          "analytics/dashboard",
          "analytics/reports"
        ]
      },
      {
        "product": "Mobile SDK",
        "description": "Mobile SDK description",
        "icon": "smartphone",
        "href": "https://mobile-sdk-docs.example.com"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## ​OpenAPI

 Integrate OpenAPI specifications directly into your navigation structure to automatically generate API documentation. Create dedicated API sections or place endpoint pages within other navigation components. Set a default OpenAPI specification at any level of your navigation hierarchy. Child elements will inherit this specification unless they define their own specification. When you add the `openapi` property to a navigation element (such as an anchor, tab, or group) without specifying any pages, Mintlify automatically generates pages for **all endpoints** defined in your OpenAPI specification.To control which endpoints appear, explicitly list the desired endpoints in a `pages` array. For more information about referencing OpenAPI endpoints in your docs, see the [OpenAPI setup](https://mintlify.com/docs/api-playground/openapi-setup).

```
{
  "navigation": {
    "groups": [
      {
        "group": "API reference",
        "openapi": "/path/to/openapi-v1.json",
        "pages": [
          "overview",
          "authentication",
          "GET /users",
          "POST /users",
          {
            "group": "Products",
            "openapi": "/path/to/openapi-v2.json",
            "pages": [
              "GET /products",
              "POST /products"
            ]
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## ​Versions

 Partition your navigation into different versions. Versions are selectable from a dropdown menu. ![Decorative graphic of a version switcher.](https://mintcdn.com/mintlify/f7fo9pnTEtzBD70_/images/navigation/versions-light.png?fit=max&auto=format&n=f7fo9pnTEtzBD70_&q=85&s=85e9cca71a814be044a285028cf9a2a1) ![Decorative graphic of a version switcher.](https://mintcdn.com/mintlify/f7fo9pnTEtzBD70_/images/navigation/versions-dark.png?fit=max&auto=format&n=f7fo9pnTEtzBD70_&q=85&s=fdb637aea218b4035afdaca14dae7d38) In the `navigation` object, `versions` is an array where each entry is an object that requires a `version` field and can contain any other navigation fields.

```
{
  "navigation": {
    "versions": [
      {
        "version": "1.0.0",
        "groups": [

            "pages": ["v1/overview", "v1/quickstart", "v1/development"]
          }
        ]
      },
      {
        "version": "2.0.0",
        "groups": [
          {
            "group": "Getting started",
            "pages": ["v2/overview", "v2/quickstart", "v2/development"]
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## ​Languages

 Partition your navigation into different languages. Languages are selectable from a dropdown menu. ![Decorative graphic of a language switcher.](https://mintcdn.com/mintlify/Y6rP0BmbzgwHuEoU/images/navigation/languages-light.png?fit=max&auto=format&n=Y6rP0BmbzgwHuEoU&q=85&s=e451ef6550588674e26e264ce2cbe399) ![Decorative graphic of a language switcher.](https://mintcdn.com/mintlify/Y6rP0BmbzgwHuEoU/images/navigation/languages-dark.png?fit=max&auto=format&n=Y6rP0BmbzgwHuEoU&q=85&s=99a90032d57cfefe2b46fb0d191391c7) In the `navigation` object, `languages` is an array where each entry is an object that requires a `language` field and can contain any other navigation fields, including language-specific banner configurations. We currently support the following languages for localization: ![https://mintcdn.com/mintlify/Y6rP0BmbzgwHuEoU/images/navigation/languages/ar.png?fit=max&auto=format&n=Y6rP0BmbzgwHuEoU&q=85&s=3d848d9025b508f338803a8ec6e0cfcf](https://mintcdn.com/mintlify/Y6rP0BmbzgwHuEoU/images/navigation/languages/ar.png?fit=max&auto=format&n=Y6rP0BmbzgwHuEoU&q=85&s=3d848d9025b508f338803a8ec6e0cfcf)

## ​Nesting

 Navigation elements can be nested within each other to create complex hierarchies. You must have one root-level parent navigation element such as tabs, groups, or a dropdown. You can nest other types of navigation elements within your primary navigation pattern. Each navigation element can contain one type of child element at each level of your navigation hierarchy. For example, a tab can contain anchors that contain groups, but a tab cannot contain both anchors and groups at the same level.

```
{
  "navigation": {
    "tabs": [
      {
        "tab": "Documentation",
        "anchors": [
          {
            "anchor": "Guides",
            "icon": "book-open",
            "pages": ["quickstart", "tutorial"]
          },
          {
            "anchor": "API Reference",
            "icon": "code",
            "pages": ["api/overview", "api/endpoints"]
          }
        ]
      },
      {
        "tab": "Resources",
        "groups": [
          {
            "group": "Help",
            "pages": ["support", "faq"]
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## ​Breadcrumbs

 Breadcrumbs display the full navigation path at the top of pages. Some themes have breadcrumbs enabled by default and others do not. You can control whether breadcrumbs are enabled for your site using the `styling` property in your `docs.json`.

```
"styling": {
  "eyebrows": "breadcrumbs"
}
```

## ​Interaction configuration

 Control how users interact with navigation elements using the `interaction` property in your `docs.json`.

### ​Enable auto-navigation for groups

 When a user expands a navigation group, some themes will automatically navigate to the first page in the group. You can override a theme’s default behavior using the `drilldown` option.

- Set to `true` to force automatic navigation to the first page when a navigation group is selected.
- Set to `false` to prevent navigation and only expand or collapse the group when it is selected.
- Leave unset to use the theme’s default behavior.

```
"interaction": {
  "drilldown": true  // Force navigation to first page when a user expands a dropdown
}
```

# Quickstart

> Deploy your documentation site and make your first change.

After you complete this guide, you’ll have a live documentation site ready to customize and update.

## ​Before you begin

 Mintlify uses a docs-as-code approach to manage your documentation. Every page on your site has a corresponding file stored in your documentation . When you connect your documentation repository to your Mintlify deployment, you can work on your documentation locally or in the web editor and sync any changes to your remote repository.

## ​Deploy your documentation site

 Go to [mintlify.com/start](https://mintlify.com/start) and complete the onboarding process. During onboarding, you’ll connect your GitHub account, create or select a repository for your documentation, and install the GitHub App to enable automatic deployments. After onboarding, your documentation site is deployed and accessible at your `.mintlify.app` URL.

Optional: Skip connecting GitHub during onboarding

If you want to get started quickly without connecting your own repository, you can skip the GitHub connection during onboarding. Mintlify creates a private repository in a private organization and automatically configures the GitHub App for you.This lets you use the web editor immediately and migrate to your own repository later.

## ​View your deployed site

 Your documentation site is now deployed at `https://<your-project-name>.mintlify.app`. Find your exact URL on the **Overview** page of your [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/). ![Overview page of the Mintlify dashboard.](https://mintcdn.com/mintlify/f7fo9pnTEtzBD70_/images/quickstart/mintlify-domain-light.png?fit=max&auto=format&n=f7fo9pnTEtzBD70_&q=85&s=282a86eda5f3ab5d9723b62a330ea2af)![Overview page of the Mintlify dashboard.](https://mintcdn.com/mintlify/f7fo9pnTEtzBD70_/images/quickstart/mintlify-domain-dark.png?fit=max&auto=format&n=f7fo9pnTEtzBD70_&q=85&s=cd2c945d8bb3c8deb4c655816e72d134) Your site is ready to view immediately. Use this URL for testing and sharing with your team. Before sharing with your users, you may want to add a [custom domain](https://mintlify.com/docs/customize/custom-domain).

## ​Make your first change

- CLI
- Web editor

1

Install the CLI

The CLI requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) v20.17.0 or higher. Use an LTS version for stability.

```

# Mintlify best practices

**Always consult [mintlify.com/docs](https://mintlify.com/docs) for components, configuration, and latest features.**

If you are not already connected to the Mintlify MCP server, [https://mintlify.com/docs/mcp](https://mintlify.com/docs/mcp), add it so that you can search more efficiently.

Mintlify is a documentation platform that transforms MDX files into documentation sites. Configure site-wide settings in the `docs.json` file, write content in MDX with YAML frontmatter, and favor built-in components over custom components.

Full schema at [mintlify.com/docs.json](https://mintlify.com/docs.json).

## Quick reference

### CLI commands

* `npm i -g mint` - Install the Mintlify CLI
* `mint dev` - Local preview at localhost:3000
* `mint broken-links` - Check internal links
* `mint a11y` - Check for accessibility issues in content
* `mint rename` - Rename/move files and update references
* `mint validate` - Validate documentation builds

### Required files

* `docs.json` - Site configuration (navigation, theme, integrations, etc.). See [global settings](https://mintlify.com/docs/settings/global) for all options.
* `*.mdx` files - Documentation pages with YAML frontmatter

### Example file structure

```
project/
├── docs.json           # Site configuration
├── introduction.mdx
├── quickstart.mdx
├── guides/
│   └── example.mdx
├── openapi.yml         # API specification
├── images/             # Static assets
│   └── example.png
└── snippets/           # Reusable components
    └── component.jsx
```

## Organize content

When a user asks about anything related to site-wide configurations, start by understanding the [global settings](https://www.mintlify.com/docs/organize/settings). See if a setting in the `docs.json` file can be updated to achieve what the user wants.

### Navigation

The `navigation` property in `docs.json` controls site structure. Choose one primary pattern at the root level, then nest others within it.

**Choose your primary pattern:**

| Pattern       | When to use                                                                                    |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Groups**    | Default. Single audience, straightforward hierarchy                                            |
| **Tabs**      | Distinct sections with different audiences (Guides vs API Reference) or content types          |
| **Anchors**   | Want persistent section links at sidebar top. Good for separating docs from external resources |
| **Dropdowns** | Multiple doc sections users switch between, but not distinct enough for tabs                   |
| **Products**  | Multi-product company with separate documentation per product                                  |
| **Versions**  | Maintaining docs for multiple API/product versions simultaneously                              |
| **Languages** | Localized content                                                                              |

**Within your primary pattern:**

* **Groups** - Organize related pages. Can nest groups within groups, but keep hierarchy shallow
* **Menus** - Add dropdown navigation within tabs for quick jumps to specific pages
* **`expanded: false`** - Collapse nested groups by default. Use for reference sections users browse selectively
* **`openapi`** - Auto-generate pages from OpenAPI spec. Add at group/tab level to inherit

**Common combinations:**

* Tabs containing groups (most common for docs with API reference)
* Products containing tabs (multi-product SaaS)
* Versions containing tabs (versioned API docs)
* Anchors containing groups (simple docs with external resource links)

### Links and paths

* **Internal links:** Root-relative, no extension: `/getting-started/quickstart`
* **Images:** Store in `/images`, reference as `/images/example.png`
* **External links:** Use full URLs, they open in new tabs automatically

## Customize docs sites

**What to customize where:**

* **Brand colors, fonts, logo** → `docs.json`. See [global settings](https://mintlify.com/docs/settings/global)
* **Component styling, layout tweaks** → `custom.css` at project root
* **Dark mode** → Enabled by default. Only disable with `"appearance": "light"` in `docs.json` if brand requires it

Start with `docs.json`. Only add `custom.css` when you need styling that config doesn't support.

## Write content

### Components

The [components overview](https://mintlify.com/docs/components) organizes all components by purpose: structure content, draw attention, show/hide content, document APIs, link to pages, and add visual context. Start there to find the right component.

**Common decision points:**

| Need                       | Use                     |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Hide optional details      | `<Accordion>`           |
| Long code examples         | `<Expandable>`          |
| User chooses one option    | `<Tabs>`                |
| Linked navigation cards    | `<Card>` in `<Columns>` |
| Sequential instructions    | `<Steps>`               |
| Code in multiple languages | `<CodeGroup>`           |
| API parameters             | `<ParamField>`          |
| API response fields        | `<ResponseField>`       |

**Callouts by severity:**

* `<Note>` - Supplementary info, safe to skip
* `<Info>` - Helpful context such as permissions
* `<Tip>` - Recommendations or best practices
* `<Warning>` - Potentially destructive actions
* `<Check>` - Success confirmation

### Reusable content

**When to use snippets:**

* Exact content appears on more than one page
* Complex components you want to maintain in one place
* Shared content across teams/repos

**When NOT to use snippets:**

* Slight variations needed per page (leads to complex props)

Import snippets with `import { Component } from "/path/to/snippet-name.jsx"`.

## Document APIs

**Choose your approach:**

* **Have an OpenAPI spec?** → Add to `docs.json` with `"openapi": ["openapi.yaml"]`. Pages auto-generate. Reference in navigation as `GET /endpoint`
* **No spec?** → Write endpoints manually with `api: "POST /users"` in frontmatter. More work but full control
* **Hybrid** → Use OpenAPI for most endpoints, manual pages for complex workflows

Encourage users to generate endpoint pages from an OpenAPI spec. It is the most efficient and easiest to maintain option.

## Deploy

Mintlify deploys automatically when changes are pushed to the connected Git repository.

**What agents can configure:**

* **Redirects** → Add to `docs.json` with `"redirects": [{"source": "/old", "destination": "/new"}]`
* **SEO indexing** → Control with `"seo": {"indexing": "all"}` to include hidden pages in search

**Requires dashboard setup (human task):**

* Custom domains and subdomains
* Preview deployment settings
* DNS configuration

For `/docs` subpath hosting with Vercel or Cloudflare, agents can help configure rewrite rules. See [/docs subpath](https://mintlify.com/docs/deploy/vercel).

## Edge cases

### Migrations

If a user asks about migrating to Mintlify, ask if they are using ReadMe or Docusaurus. If they are, use the [@mintlify/scraping](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@mintlify/scraping) CLI to migrate content. If they are using a different platform to host their documentation, help them manually convert their content to MDX pages using Mintlify components.

### Hidden pages

Any page that is not included in the `docs.json` navigation is hidden. Use hidden pages for content that should be accessible by URL or indexed for the assistant or search, but not discoverable through the sidebar navigation.

### Exclude pages

The `.mintignore` file is used to exclude files from a documentation repository from being processed.

## Common gotchas

1. **Component imports** - JSX components need explicit import, MDX components don't
2. **Frontmatter required** - Every MDX file needs `title` at minimum
3. **Code block language** - Always specify language identifier
4. **Never use `mint.json`** - `mint.json` is deprecated. Only ever use `docs.json`
