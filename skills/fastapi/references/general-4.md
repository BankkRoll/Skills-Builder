If you are helping a lot of people with their questions, you will become an official [FastAPI Expert](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/fastapi-people/#fastapi-experts). 🎉

Just remember, the most important point is: try to be kind. People come with their frustrations and in many cases don't ask in the best way, but try as best as you can to be kind. 🤗

The idea is for the **FastAPI** community to be kind and welcoming. At the same time, don't accept bullying or disrespectful behavior towards others. We have to take care of each other.

---

Here's how to help others with questions (in discussions or issues):

### Understand the question¶

- Check if you can understand what is the **purpose** and use case of the person asking.
- Then check if the question (the vast majority are questions) is **clear**.
- In many cases the question asked is about an imaginary solution from the user, but there might be a **better** one. If you can understand the problem and use case better, you might be able to suggest a better **alternative solution**.
- If you can't understand the question, ask for more **details**.

### Reproduce the problem¶

For most of the cases and most of the questions there's something related to the person's **original code**.

In many cases they will only copy a fragment of the code, but that's not enough to **reproduce the problem**.

- You can ask them to provide a [minimal, reproducible, example](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example), that you can **copy-paste** and run locally to see the same error or behavior they are seeing, or to understand their use case better.
- If you are feeling too generous, you can try to **create an example** like that yourself, just based on the description of the problem. Just keep in mind that this might take a lot of time and it might be better to ask them to clarify the problem first.

### Suggest solutions¶

- After being able to understand the question, you can give them a possible **answer**.
- In many cases, it's better to understand their **underlying problem or use case**, because there might be a better way to solve it than what they are trying to do.

### Ask to close¶

If they reply, there's a high chance you would have solved their problem, congrats, **you're a hero**! 🦸

- Now, if that solved their problem, you can ask them to:
  - In GitHub Discussions: mark the comment as the **answer**.
  - In GitHub Issues: **close** the issue.

## Watch the GitHub repository¶

You can "watch" FastAPI in GitHub (clicking the "watch" button at the top right): [https://github.com/fastapi/fastapi](https://github.com/fastapi/fastapi). 👀

If you select "Watching" instead of "Releases only" you will receive notifications when someone creates a new issue or question. You can also specify that you only want to be notified about new issues, or discussions, or PRs, etc.

Then you can try and help them solve those questions.

## Ask Questions¶

You can [create a new question](https://github.com/fastapi/fastapi/discussions/new?category=questions) in the GitHub repository, for example to:

- Ask a **question** or ask about a **problem**.
- Suggest a new **feature**.

**Note**: if you do it, then I'm going to ask you to also help others. 😉

## Review Pull Requests¶

You can help me review pull requests from others.

Again, please try your best to be kind. 🤗

---

Here's what to keep in mind and how to review a pull request:

### Understand the problem¶

- First, make sure you **understand the problem** that the pull request is trying to solve. It might have a longer discussion in a GitHub Discussion or issue.
- There's also a good chance that the pull request is not actually needed because the problem can be solved in a **different way**. Then you can suggest or ask about that.

### Don't worry about style¶

- Don't worry too much about things like commit message styles, I will squash and merge customizing the commit manually.
- Also don't worry about style rules, there are already automatized tools checking that.

And if there's any other style or consistency need, I'll ask directly for that, or I'll add commits on top with the needed changes.

### Check the code¶

- Check and read the code, see if it makes sense, **run it locally** and see if it actually solves the problem.
- Then **comment** saying that you did that, that's how I will know you really checked it.

Info

Unfortunately, I can't simply trust PRs that just have several approvals.

Several times it has happened that there are PRs with 3, 5 or more approvals, probably because the description is appealing, but when I check the PRs, they are actually broken, have a bug, or don't solve the problem they claim to solve. 😅

So, it's really important that you actually read and run the code, and let me know in the comments that you did. 🤓

- If the PR can be simplified in a way, you can ask for that, but there's no need to be too picky, there might be a lot of subjective points of view (and I will have my own as well 🙈), so it's better if you can focus on the fundamental things.

### Tests¶

- Help me check that the PR has **tests**.
- Check that the tests **fail** before the PR. 🚨
- Then check that the tests **pass** after the PR. ✅
- Many PRs don't have tests, you can **remind** them to add tests, or you can even **suggest** some tests yourself. That's one of the things that consume most time and you can help a lot with that.
- Then also comment what you tried, that way I'll know that you checked it. 🤓

## Create a Pull Request¶

You can [contribute](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/contributing/) to the source code with Pull Requests, for example:

- To fix a typo you found on the documentation.
- To share an article, video, or podcast you created or found about FastAPI by [editing this file](https://github.com/fastapi/fastapi/edit/master/docs/en/data/external_links.yml).
  - Make sure you add your link to the start of the corresponding section.
- To help [translate the documentation](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/contributing/#translations) to your language.
  - You can also help to review the translations created by others.
- To propose new documentation sections.
- To fix an existing issue/bug.
  - Make sure to add tests.
- To add a new feature.
  - Make sure to add tests.
  - Make sure to add documentation if it's relevant.

## Help Maintain FastAPI¶

Help me maintain **FastAPI**! 🤓

There's a lot of work to do, and for most of it, **YOU** can do it.

The main tasks that you can do right now are:

- [Help others with questions in GitHub](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/help-fastapi/#help-others-with-questions-in-github) (see the section above).
- [Review Pull Requests](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/help-fastapi/#review-pull-requests) (see the section above).

Those two tasks are what **consume time the most**. That's the main work of maintaining FastAPI.

If you can help me with that, **you are helping me maintain FastAPI** and making sure it keeps **advancing faster and better**. 🚀

## Join the chat¶

Join the 👥 [Discord chat server](https://discord.gg/VQjSZaeJmf) 👥 and hang out with others in the FastAPI community.

Tip

For questions, ask them in [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/fastapi/fastapi/discussions/new?category=questions), there's a much better chance you will receive help by the [FastAPI Experts](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/fastapi-people/#fastapi-experts).

Use the chat only for other general conversations.

### Don't use the chat for questions¶

Keep in mind that as chats allow more "free conversation", it's easy to ask questions that are too general and more difficult to answer, so, you might not receive answers.

In GitHub, the template will guide you to write the right question so that you can more easily get a good answer, or even solve the problem yourself even before asking. And in GitHub I can make sure I always answer everything, even if it takes some time. I can't personally do that with the chat systems. 😅

Conversations in the chat systems are also not as easily searchable as in GitHub, so questions and answers might get lost in the conversation. And only the ones in GitHub count to become a [FastAPI Expert](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/fastapi-people/#fastapi-experts), so you will most probably receive more attention in GitHub.

On the other side, there are thousands of users in the chat systems, so there's a high chance you'll find someone to talk to there, almost all the time. 😄

## Sponsor the author¶

If your **product/company** depends on or is related to **FastAPI** and you want to reach its users, you can sponsor the author (me) through [GitHub sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/tiangolo). Depending on the tier, you could get some extra benefits, like a badge in the docs. 🎁

Thanks! 🚀

# History, Design and Future¶

> FastAPI framework, high performance, easy to learn, fast to code, ready for production

# History, Design and Future¶

Some time ago, [aFastAPIuser asked](https://github.com/fastapi/fastapi/issues/3#issuecomment-454956920):

> What’s the history of this project? It seems to have come from nowhere to awesome in a few weeks [...]

Here's a little bit of that history.

## Alternatives¶

I have been creating APIs with complex requirements for several years (Machine Learning, distributed systems, asynchronous jobs, NoSQL databases, etc), leading several teams of developers.

As part of that, I needed to investigate, test and use many alternatives.

The history of **FastAPI** is in great part the history of its predecessors.

As said in the section [Alternatives](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/alternatives/):

> **FastAPI** wouldn't exist if not for the previous work of others.
>
>
>
> There have been many tools created before that have helped inspire its creation.
>
>
>
> I have been avoiding the creation of a new framework for several years. First I tried to solve all the features covered by **FastAPI** using many different frameworks, plug-ins, and tools.
>
>
>
> But at some point, there was no other option than creating something that provided all these features, taking the best ideas from previous tools, and combining them in the best way possible, using language features that weren't even available before (Python 3.6+ type hints).

## Investigation¶

By using all the previous alternatives I had the chance to learn from all of them, take ideas, and combine them in the best way I could find for myself and the teams of developers I have worked with.

For example, it was clear that ideally it should be based on standard Python type hints.

Also, the best approach was to use already existing standards.

So, before even starting to code **FastAPI**, I spent several months studying the specs for OpenAPI, JSON Schema, OAuth2, etc. Understanding their relationship, overlap, and differences.

## Design¶

Then I spent some time designing the developer "API" I wanted to have as a user (as a developer using FastAPI).

I tested several ideas in the most popular Python editors: PyCharm, VS Code, Jedi based editors.

By the last [Python Developer Survey](https://www.jetbrains.com/research/python-developers-survey-2018/#development-tools), that covers about 80% of the users.

It means that **FastAPI** was specifically tested with the editors used by 80% of the Python developers. And as most of the other editors tend to work similarly, all its benefits should work for virtually all editors.

That way I could find the best ways to reduce code duplication as much as possible, to have completion everywhere, type and error checks, etc.

All in a way that provided the best development experience for all the developers.

## Requirements¶

After testing several alternatives, I decided that I was going to use [Pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/) for its advantages.

Then I contributed to it, to make it fully compliant with JSON Schema, to support different ways to define constraint declarations, and to improve editor support (type checks, autocompletion) based on the tests in several editors.

During the development, I also contributed to [Starlette](https://www.starlette.dev/), the other key requirement.

## Development¶

By the time I started creating **FastAPI** itself, most of the pieces were already in place, the design was defined, the requirements and tools were ready, and the knowledge about the standards and specifications was clear and fresh.

## Future¶

By this point, it's already clear that **FastAPI** with its ideas is being useful for many people.

It is being chosen over previous alternatives for suiting many use cases better.

Many developers and teams already depend on **FastAPI** for their projects (including me and my team).

But still, there are many improvements and features to come.

**FastAPI** has a great future ahead.

And [your help](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/help-fastapi/) is greatly appreciated.

# How To

> FastAPI framework, high performance, easy to learn, fast to code, ready for production

# How To - Recipes¶

Here you will see different recipes or "how to" guides for **several topics**.

Most of these ideas would be more or less **independent**, and in most cases you should only need to study them if they apply directly to **your project**.

If something seems interesting and useful to your project, go ahead and check it, but otherwise, you might probably just skip them.

Tip

If you want to **learn FastAPI** in a structured way (recommended), go and read the [Tutorial - User Guide](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/) chapter by chapter instead.

FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python based on standard Python type hints.

The key features are:

- **Fast**: Very high performance, on par with **NodeJS** and **Go** (thanks to Starlette and Pydantic). [One of the fastest Python frameworks available](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/#performance).
- **Fast to code**: Increase the speed to develop features by about 200% to 300%. *
- **Fewer bugs**: Reduce about 40% of human (developer) induced errors. *
- **Intuitive**: Great editor support. Completion everywhere. Less time debugging.
- **Easy**: Designed to be easy to use and learn. Less time reading docs.
- **Short**: Minimize code duplication. Multiple features from each parameter declaration. Fewer bugs.
- **Robust**: Get production-ready code. With automatic interactive documentation.
- **Standards-based**: Based on (and fully compatible with) the open standards for APIs: [OpenAPI](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification) (previously known as Swagger) and [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/).

* estimation based on tests conducted by an internal development team, building production applications.

## FastAPI mini documentary¶

There's a [FastAPI mini documentary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpR8ngthqiE) released at the end of 2025, you can watch it online:

## Typer, the FastAPI of CLIs¶

If you are building a CLI app to be used in the terminal instead of a web API, check out [Typer](https://typer.tiangolo.com/).

**Typer** is FastAPI's little sibling. And it's intended to be the **FastAPI of CLIs**. ⌨️ 🚀

## Requirements¶

FastAPI stands on the shoulders of giants:

- [Starlette](https://www.starlette.dev/) for the web parts.
- [Pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/) for the data parts.

## Installation¶

Create and activate a [virtual environment](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/virtual-environments/) and then install FastAPI:

```
pip install "fastapi[standard]"
```

**Note**: Make sure you put `"fastapi[standard]"` in quotes to ensure it works in all terminals.

## Example¶

### Create it¶

Create a file `main.py` with:

```
from typing import Union

from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/")
def read_root():
    return {"Hello": "World"}

@app.get("/items/{item_id}")
def read_item(item_id: int, q: Union[str, None] = None):
    return {"item_id": item_id, "q": q}
```

  Or use `async def`...

If your code uses `async` / `await`, use `async def`:

```
from typing import Union

from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/")
async def read_root():
    return {"Hello": "World"}

@app.get("/items/{item_id}")
async def read_item(item_id: int, q: Union[str, None] = None):
    return {"item_id": item_id, "q": q}
```

**Note**:

If you don't know, check the *"In a hurry?"* section about [asyncandawaitin the docs](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/async/#in-a-hurry).

### Run it¶

Run the server with:

```
fastapi dev main.py
```

   About the command `fastapi dev main.py`...

The command `fastapi dev` reads your `main.py` file, detects the **FastAPI** app in it, and starts a server using [Uvicorn](https://www.uvicorn.dev).

By default, `fastapi dev` will start with auto-reload enabled for local development.

You can read more about it in the [FastAPI CLI docs](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/fastapi-cli/).

### Check it¶

Open your browser at [http://127.0.0.1:8000/items/5?q=somequery](http://127.0.0.1:8000/items/5?q=somequery).

You will see the JSON response as:

```
{"item_id": 5, "q": "somequery"}
```

You already created an API that:

- Receives HTTP requests in the *paths* `/` and `/items/{item_id}`.
- Both *paths* take `GET` *operations* (also known as HTTP *methods*).
- The *path* `/items/{item_id}` has a *path parameter* `item_id` that should be an `int`.
- The *path* `/items/{item_id}` has an optional `str` *query parameter* `q`.

### Interactive API docs¶

Now go to [http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs](http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs).

You will see the automatic interactive API documentation (provided by [Swagger UI](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui)):

![Swagger UI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/img/index/index-01-swagger-ui-simple.png)

### Alternative API docs¶

And now, go to [http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc](http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc).

You will see the alternative automatic documentation (provided by [ReDoc](https://github.com/Rebilly/ReDoc)):

![ReDoc](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/img/index/index-02-redoc-simple.png)

## Example upgrade¶

Now modify the file `main.py` to receive a body from a `PUT` request.

Declare the body using standard Python types, thanks to Pydantic.

```
from typing import Union

from fastapi import FastAPI
from pydantic import BaseModel

app = FastAPI()

class Item(BaseModel):
    name: str
    price: float
    is_offer: Union[bool, None] = None

@app.get("/")
def read_root():
    return {"Hello": "World"}

@app.get("/items/{item_id}")
def read_item(item_id: int, q: Union[str, None] = None):
    return {"item_id": item_id, "q": q}

@app.put("/items/{item_id}")
def update_item(item_id: int, item: Item):
    return {"item_name": item.name, "item_id": item_id}
```

The `fastapi dev` server should reload automatically.

### Interactive API docs upgrade¶

Now go to [http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs](http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs).

- The interactive API documentation will be automatically updated, including the new body:

![Swagger UI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/img/index/index-03-swagger-02.png)

- Click on the button "Try it out", it allows you to fill the parameters and directly interact with the API:

![Swagger UI interaction](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/img/index/index-04-swagger-03.png)

- Then click on the "Execute" button, the user interface will communicate with your API, send the parameters, get the results and show them on the screen:

![Swagger UI interaction](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/img/index/index-05-swagger-04.png)

### Alternative API docs upgrade¶

And now, go to [http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc](http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc).

- The alternative documentation will also reflect the new query parameter and body:

![ReDoc](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/img/index/index-06-redoc-02.png)

### Recap¶

In summary, you declare **once** the types of parameters, body, etc. as function parameters.

You do that with standard modern Python types.

You don't have to learn a new syntax, the methods or classes of a specific library, etc.

Just standard **Python**.

For example, for an `int`:

```
item_id: int
```

or for a more complex `Item` model:

```
item: Item
```

...and with that single declaration you get:

- Editor support, including:
  - Completion.
  - Type checks.
- Validation of data:
  - Automatic and clear errors when the data is invalid.
  - Validation even for deeply nested JSON objects.
- Conversion of input data: coming from the network to Python data and types. Reading from:
  - JSON.
  - Path parameters.
  - Query parameters.
  - Cookies.
  - Headers.
  - Forms.
  - Files.
- Conversion of output data: converting from Python data and types to network data (as JSON):
  - Convert Python types (`str`, `int`, `float`, `bool`, `list`, etc).
  - `datetime` objects.
  - `UUID` objects.
  - Database models.
  - ...and many more.
- Automatic interactive API documentation, including 2 alternative user interfaces:
  - Swagger UI.
  - ReDoc.

---

Coming back to the previous code example, **FastAPI** will:

- Validate that there is an `item_id` in the path for `GET` and `PUT` requests.
- Validate that the `item_id` is of type `int` for `GET` and `PUT` requests.
  - If it is not, the client will see a useful, clear error.
- Check if there is an optional query parameter named `q` (as in `http://127.0.0.1:8000/items/foo?q=somequery`) for `GET` requests.
  - As the `q` parameter is declared with `= None`, it is optional.
  - Without the `None` it would be required (as is the body in the case with `PUT`).
- For `PUT` requests to `/items/{item_id}`, read the body as JSON:
  - Check that it has a required attribute `name` that should be a `str`.
  - Check that it has a required attribute `price` that has to be a `float`.
  - Check that it has an optional attribute `is_offer`, that should be a `bool`, if present.
  - All this would also work for deeply nested JSON objects.
- Convert from and to JSON automatically.
- Document everything with OpenAPI, that can be used by:
  - Interactive documentation systems.
  - Automatic client code generation systems, for many languages.

We just scratched the surface, but you already get the idea of how it all works.

Try changing the line with:

```
return {"item_name": item.name, "item_id": item_id}
```

...from:

```
... "item_name": item.name ...
```

...to:

```
... "item_price": item.price ...
```

...and see how your editor will auto-complete the attributes and know their types:

For a more complete example including more features, see the [Tutorial - User Guide](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/).

**Spoiler alert**: the tutorial - user guide includes:

- Declaration of **parameters** from other different places as: **headers**, **cookies**, **form fields** and **files**.
- How to set **validation constraints** as `maximum_length` or `regex`.
- A very powerful and easy to use **Dependency Injection** system.
- Security and authentication, including support for **OAuth2** with **JWT tokens** and **HTTP Basic** auth.
- More advanced (but equally easy) techniques for declaring **deeply nested JSON models** (thanks to Pydantic).
- **GraphQL** integration with [Strawberry](https://strawberry.rocks) and other libraries.
- Many extra features (thanks to Starlette) as:
  - **WebSockets**
  - extremely easy tests based on HTTPX and `pytest`
  - **CORS**
  - **Cookie Sessions**
  - ...and more.

### Deploy your app (optional)¶

You can optionally deploy your FastAPI app to [FastAPI Cloud](https://fastapicloud.com), go and join the waiting list if you haven't. 🚀

If you already have a **FastAPI Cloud** account (we invited you from the waiting list 😉), you can deploy your application with one command.

Before deploying, make sure you are logged in:

```
fastapi login
```

Then deploy your app:

```
fastapi deploy
```

That's it! Now you can access your app at that URL. ✨

#### About FastAPI Cloud¶

**FastAPI Cloud** is built by the same author and team behind **FastAPI**.

It streamlines the process of **building**, **deploying**, and **accessing** an API with minimal effort.

It brings the same **developer experience** of building apps with FastAPI to **deploying** them to the cloud. 🎉

FastAPI Cloud is the primary sponsor and funding provider for the *FastAPI and friends* open source projects. ✨

#### Deploy to other cloud providers¶

FastAPI is open source and based on standards. You can deploy FastAPI apps to any cloud provider you choose.

Follow your cloud provider's guides to deploy FastAPI apps with them. 🤓

## Performance¶

Independent TechEmpower benchmarks show **FastAPI** applications running under Uvicorn as [one of the fastest Python frameworks available](https://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/#section=test&runid=7464e520-0dc2-473d-bd34-dbdfd7e85911&hw=ph&test=query&l=zijzen-7), only below Starlette and Uvicorn themselves (used internally by FastAPI). (*)

To understand more about it, see the section [Benchmarks](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/benchmarks/).

## Dependencies¶

FastAPI depends on Pydantic and Starlette.

### standardDependencies¶

When you install FastAPI with `pip install "fastapi[standard]"` it comes with the `standard` group of optional dependencies:

Used by Pydantic:

- [email-validator](https://github.com/JoshData/python-email-validator) - for email validation.

Used by Starlette:

- [httpx](https://www.python-httpx.org) - Required if you want to use the `TestClient`.
- [jinja2](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com) - Required if you want to use the default template configuration.
- [python-multipart](https://github.com/Kludex/python-multipart) - Required if you want to support form "parsing", with `request.form()`.

Used by FastAPI:

- [uvicorn](https://www.uvicorn.dev) - for the server that loads and serves your application. This includes `uvicorn[standard]`, which includes some dependencies (e.g. `uvloop`) needed for high performance serving.
- `fastapi-cli[standard]` - to provide the `fastapi` command.
  - This includes `fastapi-cloud-cli`, which allows you to deploy your FastAPI application to [FastAPI Cloud](https://fastapicloud.com).

### WithoutstandardDependencies¶

If you don't want to include the `standard` optional dependencies, you can install with `pip install fastapi` instead of `pip install "fastapi[standard]"`.

### Withoutfastapi-cloud-cli¶

If you want to install FastAPI with the standard dependencies but without the `fastapi-cloud-cli`, you can install with `pip install "fastapi[standard-no-fastapi-cloud-cli]"`.

### Additional Optional Dependencies¶

There are some additional dependencies you might want to install.

Additional optional Pydantic dependencies:

- [pydantic-settings](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/usage/pydantic_settings/) - for settings management.
- [pydantic-extra-types](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/usage/types/extra_types/extra_types/) - for extra types to be used with Pydantic.

Additional optional FastAPI dependencies:

- [orjson](https://github.com/ijl/orjson) - Required if you want to use `ORJSONResponse`.
- [ujson](https://github.com/esnme/ultrajson) - Required if you want to use `UJSONResponse`.
