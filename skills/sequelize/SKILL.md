## Usage Guidelines

1. **Identify relevant sections** - Match the user's question to the appropriate reference file(s)
2. **Load minimally** - Only read files directly relevant to the question to conserve context
3. **Cite sources** - Reference specific sections when answering
4. **Combine knowledge** - For complex questions, you may need multiple reference files

### When to use each reference:

- **Advanced Association Concepts**: Advanced Association Concepts-related features and documentation
- **Category**: Category-related features and documentation
- **Core Concepts**: Core Concepts-related features and documentation
- **General**: General documentation, overview, and getting started
- **Moved**: Moved-related features and documentation
- **Other Topics**: Other Topics-related features and documentation
