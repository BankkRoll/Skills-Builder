# Advanced Association Concepts

[📄️Eager LoadingAs briefly mentioned in the associations guide, eager Loading is the act of querying data of several models at once (one 'main' model and one or more associated models). At the SQL level, this is a query with one or more joins.](https://sequelize.org/docs/v6/advanced-association-concepts/eager-loading/)[📄️Creating with AssociationsAn instance can be created with nested association in one step, provided all elements are new.](https://sequelize.org/docs/v6/advanced-association-concepts/creating-with-associations/)[📄️Advanced M:N AssociationsMake sure you have read the associations guide before reading this guide.](https://sequelize.org/docs/v6/advanced-association-concepts/advanced-many-to-many/)[📄️Association ScopesThis section concerns association scopes, which are similar but not the same as model scopes.](https://sequelize.org/docs/v6/advanced-association-concepts/association-scopes/)[📄️Polymorphic Associations**Note:** the usage of polymorphic associations in Sequelize, as outlined in this guide, should be done with caution. Don't just copy-paste code from here, otherwise you might easily make mistakes and introduce bugs in your code. Make sure you understand what is going on.](https://sequelize.org/docs/v6/advanced-association-concepts/polymorphic-associations/)

# Core Concepts

[📄️Model BasicsIn this tutorial you will learn what models are in Sequelize and how to use them.](https://sequelize.org/docs/v6/core-concepts/model-basics/)[📄️Model InstancesAs you already know, a model is an ES6 class. An instance of the class represents one object from that model (which maps to one row of the table in the database). This way, model instances are DAOs.](https://sequelize.org/docs/v6/core-concepts/model-instances/)[📄️Model Querying - BasicsSequelize provides various methods to assist querying your database for data.](https://sequelize.org/docs/v6/core-concepts/model-querying-basics/)[📄️Model Querying - FindersFinder methods are the ones that generate SELECT queries.](https://sequelize.org/docs/v6/core-concepts/model-querying-finders/)[📄️Getters, Setters & VirtualsSequelize allows you to define custom getters and setters for the attributes of your models.](https://sequelize.org/docs/v6/core-concepts/getters-setters-virtuals/)[📄️Validations & ConstraintsIn this tutorial you will learn how to setup validations and constraints for your models in Sequelize.](https://sequelize.org/docs/v6/core-concepts/validations-and-constraints/)[📄️Raw QueriesAs there are often use cases in which it is just easier to execute raw / already prepared SQL queries, you can use the sequelize.query method.](https://sequelize.org/docs/v6/core-concepts/raw-queries/)[📄️AssociationsSequelize supports the standard associations: One-To-One, One-To-Many and Many-To-Many.](https://sequelize.org/docs/v6/core-concepts/assocs/)[📄️ParanoidSequelize supports the concept of paranoid tables. A paranoid table is one that, when told to delete a record, it will not truly delete it. Instead, a special column called deletedAt will have its value set to the timestamp of that deletion request.](https://sequelize.org/docs/v6/core-concepts/paranoid/)

# Other topics

[📄️Other Data TypesApart from the most common data types mentioned in the Model Basics guide, Sequelize provides several other data types.](https://sequelize.org/docs/v6/other-topics/other-data-types/)[📄️Using sequelize in AWS LambdaAWS Lambda is a serverless computing service that allows customers](https://sequelize.org/docs/v6/other-topics/aws-lambda/)[📄️Connection PoolIf you're connecting to the database from a single process, you should create only one Sequelize instance. Sequelize will set up a connection pool on initialization. This connection pool can be configured through the constructor's options parameter (using options.pool), as is shown in the following example:](https://sequelize.org/docs/v6/other-topics/connection-pool/)[📄️Constraints & CircularitiesAdding constraints between tables means that tables must be created in the database in a certain order, when using sequelize.sync. If Task has a reference to User, the User table must be created before the Task table can be created. This can sometimes lead to circular references, where Sequelize cannot find an order in which to sync. Imagine a scenario of documents and versions. A document can have multiple versions, and for convenience, a document has a reference to its current version.](https://sequelize.org/docs/v6/other-topics/constraints-and-circularities/)[📄️Dialect-Specific ThingsUnderlying Connector Libraries](https://sequelize.org/docs/v6/other-topics/dialect-specific-things/)[📄️Extending Data TypesMost likely the type you are trying to implement is already included in DataTypes. If a new datatype is not included, this manual will show how to write it yourself.](https://sequelize.org/docs/v6/other-topics/extending-data-types/)[📄️HooksHooks (also known as lifecycle events), are functions which are called before and after calls in sequelize are executed. For example, if you want to always set a value on a model before saving it, you can add a beforeUpdate hook.](https://sequelize.org/docs/v6/other-topics/hooks/)[📄️IndexesSequelize supports adding indexes to the model definition which will be created on sequelize.sync().](https://sequelize.org/docs/v6/other-topics/indexes/)[📄️Working with Legacy TablesWhile out of the box Sequelize will seem a bit opinionated it's easy to work legacy tables and forward proof your application by defining (otherwise generated) table and field names.](https://sequelize.org/docs/v6/other-topics/legacy/)[📄️Legal NoticeLicense](https://sequelize.org/docs/v6/other-topics/legal/)[📄️MigrationsJust like you use version control systems such as Git to manage changes in your source code, you can use migrations to keep track of changes to the database. With migrations you can transfer your existing database into another state and vice versa: Those state transitions are saved in migration files, which describe how to get to the new state and how to revert the changes in order to get back to the old state.](https://sequelize.org/docs/v6/other-topics/migrations/)[📄️Naming StrategiesThe underscored option](https://sequelize.org/docs/v6/other-topics/naming-strategies/)[📄️Optimistic LockingSequelize has built-in support for optimistic locking through a model instance version count.](https://sequelize.org/docs/v6/other-topics/optimistic-locking/)[📄️Query InterfaceAn instance of Sequelize uses something called Query Interface to communicate to the database in a dialect-agnostic way. Most of the methods you've learned in this manual are implemented with the help of several methods from the query interface.](https://sequelize.org/docs/v6/other-topics/query-interface/)[📄️Read ReplicationSequelize supports read replication, i.e. having multiple servers that you can connect to when you want to do a SELECT query. When you do read replication, you specify one or more servers to act as read replicas, and one server to act as the main writer, which handles all writes and updates and propagates them to the replicas (note that the actual replication process is not handled by Sequelize, but should be set up by database backend).](https://sequelize.org/docs/v6/other-topics/read-replication/)[📄️ResourcesAddons & Plugins](https://sequelize.org/docs/v6/other-topics/resources/)[📄️ScopesScopes are used to help you reuse code. You can define commonly used queries, specifying options such as where, include, limit, etc.](https://sequelize.org/docs/v6/other-topics/scopes/)[📄️Sub QueriesConsider you have two models, Post and Reaction, with a One-to-Many relationship set up, so that one post has many reactions:](https://sequelize.org/docs/v6/other-topics/sub-queries/)[📄️TransactionsSequelize does not use transactions by default. However, for production-ready usage of Sequelize, you should definitely configure Sequelize to use transactions.](https://sequelize.org/docs/v6/other-topics/transactions/)[📄️TypeScriptWe're working hard on making Sequelize a breeze to use in TypeScript.](https://sequelize.org/docs/v6/other-topics/typescript/)[📄️Upgrade to v6Sequelize v6 is the next major release after v5. Below is a list of breaking changes to help you upgrade.](https://sequelize.org/docs/v6/other-topics/upgrade/)
