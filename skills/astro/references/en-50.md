The currently configured adapter does not support server-side rendering, which is required for the current project setup.

Depending on your adapter, there may be a different entrypoint to use for server-side rendering. For example, the `@astrojs/vercel` adapter has a `@astrojs/vercel/static` entrypoint for static rendering, and a `@astrojs/vercel/serverless` entrypoint for server-side rendering.

> **i18nNotEnabled**: The `astro:i18n` module can not be used without enabling i18n in your Astro config.

## What went wrong?

[Section titled “What went wrong?”](#what-went-wrong)

The `astro:i18n` module can not be used without enabling i18n in your Astro config. To enable i18n, add a default locale and a list of supported locales to your Astro config:

```
import { defineConfig } from 'astro'export default defineConfig({ i18n: {   locales: ['en', 'fr'],   defaultLocale: 'en',  },})
```

# Image missing required "alt" property.

## What went wrong?

[Section titled “What went wrong?”](#what-went-wrong)

The `alt` property allows you to provide descriptive alt text to users of screen readers and other assistive technologies. In order to ensure your images are accessible, the `Image` component requires that an `alt` be specified.

If the image is merely decorative (i.e. doesn’t contribute to the understanding of the page), set `alt=""` so that screen readers know to ignore the image.
