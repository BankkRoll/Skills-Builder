# Migrating from NuxtJS

Here are some key concepts and migration strategies to help you get started. Use the rest of our docs and our [Discord community](https://astro.build/chat) to keep going!

> This guide is referring to [Nuxt 2](https://nuxtjs.org/), not the newer Nuxt 3. While some of the concepts are similar, Nuxt 3 is a newer version of the framework and may require different strategies for parts of your migration.

## Key Similarities between Nuxt and Astro

[Section titled “Key Similarities between Nuxt and Astro”](#key-similarities-between-nuxt-and-astro)

Nuxt and Astro share some similarities that will help you migrate your project:

- Astro projects can also be SSG or [SSR with page level prerendering](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/on-demand-rendering/).
- Astro uses file-based routing, and [allows specially named pages to create dynamic routes](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/routing/#dynamic-routes).
- Astro is [component-based](https://docs.astro.build/en/basics/astro-components/), and your markup structure will be similar before and after your migration.
- Astro has [an official integration for using Vue components](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/vue/).
- Astro has support for [installing NPM packages](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/imports/#npm-packages), including Vue libraries. You may be able to keep some or all of your existing Vue components and dependencies.

## Key Differences between Nuxt and Astro

[Section titled “Key Differences between Nuxt and Astro”](#key-differences-between-nuxt-and-astro)

When you rebuild your Nuxt site in Astro, you will notice some important differences:

- Nuxt is a Vue-based SPA (single-page application). Astro sites are multi-page apps built using `.astro` components, but can also support React, Preact, Vue.js, Svelte, SolidJS, AlpineJS, and raw HTML templating.
- [Page Routing](https://docs.astro.build/en/basics/astro-pages/#file-based-routing): Nuxt uses `vue-router` for SPA routing, and `vue-meta` for managing `<head>`. In Astro, you will create separate HTML page routes and control your page `<head>` directly, or in a layout component.
- [content-driven](https://docs.astro.build/en/concepts/why-astro/#content-driven): Astro was designed to showcase your content and to allow you to opt-in to interactivity only as needed. An existing Nuxt app may be built for high client-side interactivity. Astro has built-in capabilities for working with your content, such as page generation, but may require advanced Astro techniques to include items that are more challenging to replicate using `.astro` components, such as dashboards.

## Convert your NuxtJS Project

[Section titled “Convert your NuxtJS Project”](#convert-your-nuxtjs-project)

Each project migration will look different, but there are some common actions you will perform when converting from Nuxt to Astro.

### Create a new Astro project

[Section titled “Create a new Astro project”](#create-a-new-astro-project)

Use the `create astro` command for your package manager to launch Astro’s CLI wizard or choose a community theme from the [Astro Theme Showcase](https://astro.build/themes).

You can pass a `--template` argument to the `create astro` command to start a new Astro project with one of our official starters (e.g. `docs`, `blog`, `portfolio`). Or, you can [start a new project from any existing Astro repository on GitHub](https://docs.astro.build/en/install-and-setup/#install-from-the-cli-wizard).

- [npm](#tab-panel-3130)
- [pnpm](#tab-panel-3131)
- [Yarn](#tab-panel-3132)

   Terminal window

```
# launch the Astro CLI Wizardnpm create astro@latest
# create a new project with an official examplenpm create astro@latest -- --template <example-name>
```

   Terminal window

```
# launch the Astro CLI Wizardpnpm create astro@latest
# create a new project with an official examplepnpm create astro@latest --template <example-name>
```

   Terminal window

```
# launch the Astro CLI Wizardyarn create astro@latest
# create a new project with an official exampleyarn create astro@latest --template <example-name>
```

Then, copy your existing Nuxt project files over to your new Astro project in a separate folder outside of `src`.

### Install integrations (optional)

[Section titled “Install integrations (optional)”](#install-integrations-optional)

You may find it useful to install some of [Astro’s optional integrations](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/) to use while converting your Nuxt project to Astro:

- **@astrojs/vue**: to reuse some existing Vue UI components in your new Astro site, or keep writing with Vue components.
- **@astrojs/mdx**: to bring existing MDX files from your Nuxt project, or to use MDX in your new Astro site.

### Put your source code insrc

[Section titled “Put your source code in src”](#put-your-source-code-in-src)

1. **Move** the contents of Nuxt’s `static/` folder into `public/`.
  Astro uses the `public/` directory for static assets, similar to Nuxt’s `static/` folder.
2. **Copy or Move** Nuxt’s other files and folders (e.g. `pages`, `layouts` etc.) into Astro’s `src/` folder.
  Like Nuxt, Astro’s `src/pages/` folder is a special folder used for file-based routing. All other folders are optional, and you can organize the contents of your `src/` folder any way you like. Other common folders in Astro projects include `src/layouts/`, `src/components`, `src/styles`, `src/scripts`.

### Convert Vue SFC pages to.astrofiles

[Section titled “Convert Vue SFC pages to .astro files”](#convert-vue-sfc-pages-to-astro-files)

Here are some tips for converting a Nuxt `.vue` component into a `.astro` component:

1. Use the `<template>` of the existing NuxtJS component function as the basis for your HTML template.
2. Change any [Nuxt or Vue syntax to Astro](#reference-convert-nuxtjs-syntax-to-astro) or to HTML web standards. This includes `<NuxtLink>`, `:class`, `{{variable}}`, and `v-if`, for example.
3. Move `<script>` JavaScript, into a “code fence” (`---`). Convert your component’s data-fetching properties to server-side JavaScript - see [Nuxt data fetching to Astro](#nuxt-data-fetching-to-astro).
4. Use `Astro.props` to access any additional props that were previously passed to your Vue component.
5. Decide whether any imported components also need to be converted to Astro. With the official integration installed, you can [use existing Vue components in your Astro file](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/vue/). But, you may want to convert them to Astro, especially if they do not need to be interactive!

See [an example from a Nuxt app converted step-by-step](#guided-example-see-the-steps).

#### Compare: Vue vs Astro

[Section titled “Compare: Vue vs Astro”](#compare-vue-vs-astro)

Compare the following Nuxt component and a corresponding Astro component:

- [Vue](#tab-panel-3128)
- [Astro](#tab-panel-3129)

   Page.vue

```
<template>  <div>    <p v-if="message === 'Not found'">      The repository you're looking up doesn't exist    </p>    <div v-else>      <Header/>      <p class="banner">Astro has {{stars}} 🧑‍🚀</p>      <Footer />    </div>  </div></template>
<script>import Vue from 'vue'
export default Vue.extend({  name: 'IndexPage',  async asyncData() {    const res = await fetch('https://api.github.com/repos/withastro/astro')    const json = await res.json();    return {      message: json.message,      stars: json.stargazers_count || 0,    };  }});</script>
<style scoped>.banner {  background-color: #f4f4f4;  padding: 1em 1.5em;  text-align: center;  margin-bottom: 1em;}<style>
```

   Page.astro

```
---import Header from "./header";import Footer from './footer';import "./layout.css";
const res = await fetch('https://api.github.com/repos/withastro/astro')const json = await res.json()const message = json.message;const stars = json.stargazers_count || 0;---
{message === "Not Found" ?      <p>The repository you're looking up doesn't exist</p> :      <>            <Header />            <p class="banner">Astro has {stars} 🧑‍🚀</p>            <Footer />        </>}
<style>  .banner {    background-color: #f4f4f4;    padding: 1em 1.5em;    text-align: center;    margin-bottom: 1em;  }<style>
```

### Migrating Layout Files

[Section titled “Migrating Layout Files”](#migrating-layout-files)

You may find it helpful to start by converting your Nuxt layouts and templates into [Astro layout components](https://docs.astro.build/en/basics/layouts/).

Each Astro page explicitly requires `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` tags to be present. Your Nuxt `layout.vue` and templates will not include these.

Note the standard HTML templating, and direct access to `<head>`:

 src/layouts/Layout.astro

```
<html lang="en">  <head>    <meta charset="utf-8" />    <link rel="icon" type="image/svg+xml" href="/favicon.svg" />    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width" />    <title>Astro</title>  </head>  <body>        <slot />  </body></html>
```

You may also wish to reuse code from [your Nuxt’s page’sheadproperty](https://nuxtjs.org/docs/configuration-glossary/configuration-head/#the-head-property) to include additional site metadata. Notice that Astro uses neither `vue-meta` nor a component’s `head` property but instead creates `<head>` directly. You may import and use components, even within `<head>`, to separate and organize your page content.

### Migrating Pages and Posts

[Section titled “Migrating Pages and Posts”](#migrating-pages-and-posts)

In NuxtJS, your [pages](https://docs.astro.build/en/basics/astro-pages/) live in `/pages`. In Astro, all your page content must live within `src/` unless you are using [content collections](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/).

#### Vue Pages

[Section titled “Vue Pages”](#vue-pages)

Your existing Nuxt Vue (`.vue`) pages will need to be [converted from Vue files to.astropages](#convert-vue-sfc-pages-to-astro-files). You cannot use an existing Vue page file in Astro.

These [.astropages](https://docs.astro.build/en/basics/astro-pages/) must be located within `src/pages/` and will have page routes generated automatically based on their file path.

##### Dynamic File Path Naming

[Section titled “Dynamic File Path Naming”](#dynamic-file-path-naming)

In Nuxt, your dynamic pages use an underscore to represent a dynamic page property that’s then passed to the page generation:

- Directorypages/
  - Directorypokemon/
    - _name.vue
  - index.vue
- nuxt.config.js

To convert to Astro, change this underscored dynamic path property (e.g. `_name.vue`) to be wrapped in a pair of square brackets (e.g. `[name].astro`):

- Directorysrc/
  - Directorypages/
    - Directorypokemon/
      - [name].astro
    - index.astro
- astro.config.mjs

#### Markdown and MDX pages

[Section titled “Markdown and MDX pages”](#markdown-and-mdx-pages)

Astro has built-in support for Markdown and an optional integration for MDX files. You can reuse any existing Markdown and MDX pages, but they may require some adjustments to their frontmatter, such as adding [Astro’s speciallayoutfrontmatter property](https://docs.astro.build/en/basics/layouts/#markdown-layouts).

You will no longer need to manually create pages for each Markdown-generated route or use an external package like `@nuxt/content`. These files can be placed within `src/pages/` to take advantage of automatic file-based routing.

When part of a [content collection](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/), you will [generate pages dynamically](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/#generating-routes-from-content) from your content entries.

### Migrating Tests

[Section titled “Migrating Tests”](#migrating-tests)

As Astro outputs raw HTML, it is possible to write end-to-end tests using the output of the build step. Any end-to-end tests written previously might work out-of-the-box, if you have been able to match the markup of your Nuxt site. Testing libraries such as Jest and Vue Testing Library can be imported and used in Astro to test your Vue components.

See Astro’s [testing guide](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/testing/) for more.

## Reference: Convert NuxtJS Syntax to Astro

[Section titled “Reference: Convert NuxtJS Syntax to Astro”](#reference-convert-nuxtjs-syntax-to-astro)

### Nuxt Local Variables to Astro

[Section titled “Nuxt Local Variables to Astro”](#nuxt-local-variables-to-astro)

To use local variables in an Astro component’s HTML, change the set of two curly braces to one set of curly braces:

 src/components/Component.astro

```
---const message = "Hello!"---<p>{{message}}</p><p>{message}</p>
```

### Nuxt Property Passing to Astro

[Section titled “Nuxt Property Passing to Astro”](#nuxt-property-passing-to-astro)

To bind an attribute or component property in an Astro component, change this syntax to the following:

 src/components/Component.astro

```
------<p v-bind:aria-label="message">...</p><p :aria-label="message">...</p><Header title="Page"/>
<p aria-label={message}>...</p><Header title={"Page"}/>
```

### Nuxt Links to Astro

[Section titled “Nuxt Links to Astro”](#nuxt-links-to-astro)

Convert any Nuxt `<NuxtLink to="">` components to HTML `<a href="">` tags.

```
<NuxtLink to="/blog">Blog</Link><a href="/blog">Blog</a>
```

Astro does not use any special component for links, although you are welcome to build custom link components. You can then import and use this `<Link>` just as you would any other component.

 src/components/Link.astro

```
---const { to } = Astro.props---<a href={to}><slot /></a>
```

### Nuxt Imports to Astro

[Section titled “Nuxt Imports to Astro”](#nuxt-imports-to-astro)

If necessary, update any [file imports](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/imports/) to reference relative file paths exactly. This can be done using [import aliases](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/typescript/#import-aliases), or by writing out a relative path in full.

Note that `.astro` and several other file types must be imported with their full file extension.

 src/pages/authors/Fred.astro

```
---import Card from `../../components/Card.astro`;---<Card />
```

### Nuxt Dynamic Page Generation to Astro

[Section titled “Nuxt Dynamic Page Generation to Astro”](#nuxt-dynamic-page-generation-to-astro)

In Nuxt, to generate a dynamic page you either must:

- Use SSR.
- [Use thegeneratefunction innuxt.config.js](https://nuxtjs.org/docs/configuration-glossary/configuration-generate/) to define all possible static routes.

In Astro, you similarly have two choices:

- [Use SSR](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/on-demand-rendering/).
- Export a `getStaticPaths()` function in the frontmatter of an Astro page to tell the framework which [static routes to generate dynamically](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/routing/#dynamic-routes).

#### Convert ageneratefunction in Nuxt to agetStaticPathsfunction in Astro.

[Section titled “Convert a generate function in Nuxt to a getStaticPaths function in Astro.”](#convert-a-generate-function-in-nuxt-to-a-getstaticpaths-function-in-astro)

To generate multiple pages, replace the function to create routes in your `nuxt.config.js` with `getStaticPaths()` directly inside a dynamic routing page itself:

 nuxt.config.js

```
{  // ...    generate: {        async routes() {          // Axios is required here unless you're using Node 18          const res = await axios.get("https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon?limit=151")          const pokemons = res.data.results;          return pokemons.map(pokemon => {            return '/pokemon/' + pokemon.name          })        }      }}
```

 src/pages/pokemon/[name].astro

```
---export const getStaticPaths = async () => {  const res = await fetch("https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon?limit=151")  const resJson = await res.json();  const pokemons = resJson.results;  return pokemons.map(({ name }) => ({      params: { name },    }))}// ...---
```

### Nuxt Data Fetching to Astro

[Section titled “Nuxt Data Fetching to Astro”](#nuxt-data-fetching-to-astro)

Nuxt has two methods of fetching server-side data:

- [asyncDataoptions API](https://nuxtjs.org/docs/features/data-fetching/#async-data)
- [fetchhook](https://nuxtjs.org/docs/features/data-fetching/#the-fetch-hook)

In Astro, fetch data inside of your page’s code fence.

Migrate the following:

 pages/index.vue

```
{  // ...  async asyncData() {    const res = await fetch("https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon?limit=151")    const resJson = await res.json();    const pokemons = resJson.results;    return {      pokemons,    }  },}
```

To a code fence without a wrapper function:

 src/pages/index.astro

```
---const res = await fetch("https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon?limit=151")const resJson = await res.json();const pokemons = resJson.results;---

```

### Nuxt Styling to Astro

[Section titled “Nuxt Styling to Astro”](#nuxt-styling-to-astro)

Nuxt utilizes Vue’s component styling to generate a page’s style.

 pages/index.vue

```
<template>  </template>
<script>  // Your server logic here</script>
<style scoped>    .class {        color: red;    }</style>
```

Similarly, in Astro you can drop in a `<style>` element in your page’s template to provide scoped styles to the component.

 src/pages/index.vue

```
---// Your server logic here---
<style>    .class {        color: red;    }</style>
```

#### Global Styling

[Section titled “Global Styling”](#global-styling)

`<style>`  tags are `scoped` by default in Astro. To make a `<style>` tag global, mark it with the `is:global` attribute:

 src/pages/index.vue

```
<style is:global>  p {    color: red;  }</style>
```

#### Pre-processor support

[Section titled “Pre-processor support”](#pre-processor-support)

[Astro supports the most popular CSS preprocessors](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/styling/#css-preprocessors) by installing them as a dev dependency. For example, to use SCSS:

 Terminal window

```
npm install -D sass
```

After doing so, you’re then able to use `.scss` or `.sass` styled without modification from your Vue components.

 src/layouts/Layout.astro

```
<p>Hello, world</p><style lang="scss">p {   color: black;
   &:hover {       color: red;   }}</style>
```

See more about [Styling in Astro](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/styling/).

### Nuxt Image Plugin to Astro

[Section titled “Nuxt Image Plugin to Astro”](#nuxt-image-plugin-to-astro)

Convert any [Nuxt<nuxt-img/>or<nuxt-picture/>components](https://image.nuxt.com/usage/nuxt-img) to [Astro’s own image component](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/images/) in `.astro` or `.mdx` files, or to a [standard HTML<img>](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/images/#images-in-ui-framework-components) or `<picture>` tag as appropriate in your Vue components.

Astro’s `<Image />` component works in `.astro` and `.mdx` files only. See a [full list of its component attributes](https://docs.astro.build/en/reference/modules/astro-assets/#image-) and note that several will differ from Nuxt’s attributes.

 src/pages/index.astro

```
---import { Image } from 'astro:assets';import rocket from '../assets/rocket.png';---<Image src={rocket} alt="A rocketship in space." /><img src={rocket.src} alt="A rocketship in space.">
```

In Vue (`.vue`) components within your Astro app, use standard JSX image syntax (`<img />`). Astro will not optimize these images, but you can install and use NPM packages for more flexibility.

You can learn more about [using images in Astro](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/images/) in the Images Guide.

## Guided example: See the steps!

[Section titled “Guided example: See the steps!”](#guided-example-see-the-steps)

Here is an example of Nuxt Pokédex data fetch converted to Astro.

`pages/index.vue` fetches and displays a list of the first 151 Pokémon using [the REST PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co/).

Here’s how to recreate that in `src/pages/index.astro`, replacing `asyncData()` with `fetch()`.

1. Identify the `<template>` and `<style>` in the Vue SFC.
   pages/index.vue
  ```
  <template>  <ul class="plain-list pokeList">            <li v-for="pokemon of pokemons" class="pokemonListItem" :key="pokemon.name">                <NuxtLink class="pokemonContainer" :to="`/pokemon/${pokemon.name}`">                    <p class="pokemonId">No. {{pokemon.id}}</p>                    <img                      class="pokemonImage"                      :src="`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PokeAPI/sprites/master/sprites/pokemon/${pokemon.id}.png`"                      :alt="`${pokemon.name} picture`"/>                    <h2 class="pokemonName">{{pokemon.name}}</h2>                </NuxtLink>            </li>    </ul></template>
  <script>import Vue from 'vue'export default Vue.extend({  name: 'IndexPage',  layout: 'default',  async asyncData() {    const res = await fetch("https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon?limit=151")    const resJson = await res.json();    const pokemons = resJson.results.map(pokemon => {        const name = pokemon.name;        // https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/1/        const url = pokemon.url;        const id = url.split("/")[url.split("/").length - 2];        return {            name,            url,            id        }    });    return {      pokemons,    }  },  head() {    return {      title: "Pokedex: Generation 1"    }  }});</script>
  <style scoped>.pokeList {  display: grid;  grid-template-columns: repeat( auto-fit, minmax(250px, 1fr) );  gap: 1rem;}
  /* ... */</style>
  ```
2. Create `src/pages/index.astro`
  Use the `<template>` and `<style>` tags of the Nuxt SFC. Convert any Nuxt or Vue syntax to Astro.
  Note that:
  - `<template>` is removed
  - `<style>` has its `scoped` attribute removed
  - `v-for` becomes `.map`.
  - `:attr="val"` becomes `attr={val}`
  - `<NuxtLink>` becomes `<a>`.
  - The `<> </>` fragment is not required in Astro templating.
   src/pages/index.astro
  ```
  ------<ul class="plain-list pokeList">    {pokemons.map((pokemon) => (        <li class="pokemonListItem" key={pokemon.name}>            <a class="pokemonContainer" href={`/pokemon/${pokemon.name}`}>                <p class="pokemonId">No. {pokemon.id}</p>                <img class="pokemonImage" src={`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PokeAPI/sprites/master/sprites/pokemon/${pokemon.id}.png`} alt={`${pokemon.name} picture`}/>                <h2 class="pokemonName">{pokemon.name}</h2>            </a>        </li>    ))}</ul>
  <style>.pokeList {  display: grid;  grid-template-columns: repeat( auto-fit, minmax(250px, 1fr) );  gap: 1rem;}
  /* ... */</style>
  ```
3. Add any needed imports, props and JavaScript
  Note that:
  - The `asyncData` function is no longer needed. Data from the API is fetched directly in the code fence.
  - A `<Layout>` component is imported, and wraps the page templating.
    - Our `head()` Nuxt method is passed to the `<Layout>` component, which is passed to the `<title>` element as a property.
   src/pages/index.astro
  ```
  ---import Layout from '../layouts/layout.astro';
  const res = await fetch("https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon?limit=151");const resJson = await res.json();const pokemons = resJson.results.map(pokemon => {    const name = pokemon.name;    // https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/1/    const url = pokemon.url;    const id = url.split("/")[url.split("/").length - 2];    return {        name,        url,        id    }});---
  <Layout title="Pokedex: Generation 1">  <ul class="plain-list pokeList">      {pokemons.map((pokemon) => (          <li class="pokemonListItem" key={pokemon.name}>              <a class="pokemonContainer" href={`/pokemon/${pokemon.name}`}>                  <p class="pokemonId">No. {pokemon.id}</p>                  <img class="pokemonImage" src={`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PokeAPI/sprites/master/sprites/pokemon/${pokemon.id}.png`} alt={`${pokemon.name} picture`}/>                  <h2 class="pokemonName">{pokemon.name}</h2>              </a>          </li>      ))}  </ul></Layout>
  <style>.pokeList {  display: grid;  grid-template-columns: repeat( auto-fit, minmax(250px, 1fr) );  gap: 1rem;}
  /* ... */</style>
  ```

# Migrating from Pelican

> Tips for migrating an existing Pelican project to Astro

# Migrating from Pelican

[Pelican](https://getpelican.com) is an open-source static site generator built on Python.

## Key Similarities between Pelican and Astro

[Section titled “Key Similarities between Pelican and Astro”](#key-similarities-between-pelican-and-astro)

Pelican and Astro share some similarities that will help you migrate your project:

- Pelican and Astro are both static-site generators, ideally suited to [content-driven websites](https://docs.astro.build/en/concepts/why-astro/#content-driven) like blogs.
- Pelican and Astro both have built-in support for [writing in Markdown](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/markdown-content/), including frontmatter YAML properties for page metadata. However, Astro has very few reserved frontmatter properties compared to Pelican. Even though many of your existing Pelican frontmatter properties will not be “special” in Astro, you can continue to use your existing Markdown files and frontmatter values.

## Key Differences between Pelican and Astro

[Section titled “Key Differences between Pelican and Astro”](#key-differences-between-pelican-and-astro)

When you rebuild your Pelican site in Astro, you will notice some important differences:

- Pelican supports writing content in Markdown and reStructured Text (`.rst`). Astro supports [creating pages from Markdown and MDX](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/markdown-content/) files, but does not support reStructured Text.
- Pelican uses HTML files and Jinja syntax for templating. [Astro syntax](https://docs.astro.build/en/basics/astro-components/) is a JSX-like superset of HTML. All valid HTML is valid `.astro` syntax.
- Pelican was designed to build content-rich websites like blogs and has some built-in, blog features that you would have to build yourself in Astro. Instead, Astro offers some of these features included in an [official blog theme](https://github.com/withastro/astro/tree/latest/examples/blog).

## Switch from Pelican to Astro

[Section titled “Switch from Pelican to Astro”](#switch-from-pelican-to-astro)

To convert a Pelican documentation site to Astro, start with our official [Starlight docs theme starter template](https://starlight.astro.build), or explore more community themes in our [theme showcase](https://astro.build/themes/).

You can pass a `--template` argument to the `create astro` command to start a new Astro project with one of our official starters. Or, you can [start a new project from any existing Astro repository on GitHub](https://docs.astro.build/en/install-and-setup/#install-from-the-cli-wizard).

- [npm](#tab-panel-3122)
- [pnpm](#tab-panel-3123)
- [Yarn](#tab-panel-3124)

   Terminal window

```
npm create astro@latest -- --template starlight
```

   Terminal window

```
pnpm create astro@latest --template starlight
```

   Terminal window

```
yarn create astro --template starlight
```

Bring your existing Markdown content files to [create Markdown pages](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/markdown-content/). You can still take advantage of [file-based routing](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/routing/) by copying these documents from Pelican’s `content/` folder into `src/pages/` in Astro. You may wish to read about [Astro’s project structure](https://docs.astro.build/en/basics/project-structure/) to learn where files should be located.

Pelican may have handled much of your site layout and metadata for you. You may wish to read about [building Astro Layouts as Markdown page wrappers](https://docs.astro.build/en/basics/layouts/#markdown-layouts) to see how to manage templating yourself in Astro, including your page `<head>`.

Like Pelican, Astro has many plugins that extend its functionality. Explore the [official list of integrations](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/) for adding features such as MDX support, and find hundreds more of community-maintained integrations in the [Astro Integrations Directory](https://astro.build/integrations/). You can even use the [Astro Integration API](https://docs.astro.build/en/reference/integrations-reference/) to build your own custom integration to extend your project’s features.

To convert other types of sites, such as a portfolio or a blog, see more official starter templates on [astro.new](https://astro.new). You’ll find a link to each project’s GitHub repository, as well as one-click links to open a working project in IDX, StackBlitz, CodeSandbox and Gitpod online development environments.

# Migrating from SvelteKit

> Tips for migrating an existing SvelteKit project to Astro

# Migrating from SvelteKit

[SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev) is a framework for building web applications on top of Svelte.

## Key Similarities between SvelteKit and Astro

[Section titled “Key Similarities between SvelteKit and Astro”](#key-similarities-between-sveltekit-and-astro)

SvelteKit and Astro share some similarities that will help you migrate your project:

- Both SvelteKit and Astro are modern JavaScript static-site generators and server-side rendering frameworks.
- Both SvelteKit and Astro use a [src/folder for your project files](https://docs.astro.build/en/basics/project-structure/#src) and a [special folder for file-based routing](https://docs.astro.build/en/basics/astro-pages/). Creating and managing pages for your site should feel familiar.
- Astro has [an official integration for using Svelte components](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/svelte/) and supports [installing NPM packages](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/imports/#npm-packages), including several for Svelte. You will be able to write Svelte UI components, and may be able to keep some or all of your existing components and dependencies.
- Astro and SvelteKit both allow you to use a [headless CMS, APIs or Markdown files for data](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/data-fetching/). You can continue to use your preferred content authoring system, and will be able to keep your existing content.

## Key Differences between SvelteKit and Astro

[Section titled “Key Differences between SvelteKit and Astro”](#key-differences-between-sveltekit-and-astro)

When you rebuild your SvelteKit site in Astro, you will notice some important differences:

- Astro sites are multi-page apps, whereas SvelteKit defaults to SPAs (single-page applications) with server-side rendering, but can also create MPAs, traditional SPAs, or you can mix and match these techniques within an app.
- [Components](https://docs.astro.build/en/basics/astro-components/): SvelteKit uses [Svelte](https://svelte.dev). Astro pages are built using [.astrocomponents](https://docs.astro.build/en/basics/astro-components/), but can also support [React, Preact, Vue.js, Svelte, SolidJS, AlpineJS](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/framework-components/) and raw HTML templating.
- [content-driven](https://docs.astro.build/en/concepts/why-astro/#content-driven): Astro was designed to showcase your content and to allow you to opt-in to interactivity only as needed. An existing SvelteKit app might be built for high client-side interactivity. Astro has built-in capabilities for working with your content, such as page generation, but may require advanced Astro techniques to include items that are more challenging to replicate using `.astro` components, such as dashboards.
- [Markdown-ready](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/markdown-content/): Astro includes built-in Markdown support, and includes a [special frontmatter YAMLlayoutproperty](https://docs.astro.build/en/basics/layouts/#markdown-layouts) used per-file for page templating. If you are converting a SvelteKit Markdown-based blog, you will not have to install a separate Markdown integration and you will not set a layout via a configuration file. You can bring your existing Markdown files, but you may need to reorganize as Astro’s file-based routing does not require a folder for each page route.

## Switch from SvelteKit to Astro

[Section titled “Switch from SvelteKit to Astro”](#switch-from-sveltekit-to-astro)

To convert a SvelteKit blog to Astro, start with our blog theme starter template, or explore more community blog themes in our [theme showcase](https://astro.build/themes/).

You can pass a `--template` argument to the `create astro` command to start a new Astro project with one of our official starters. Or, you can [start a new project from any existing Astro repository on GitHub](https://docs.astro.build/en/install-and-setup/#install-from-the-cli-wizard).

- [npm](#tab-panel-3133)
- [pnpm](#tab-panel-3134)
- [Yarn](#tab-panel-3135)

   Terminal window

```
npm create astro@latest -- --template blog
```

   Terminal window

```
pnpm create astro@latest --template blog
```

   Terminal window

```
yarn create astro --template blog
```

Bring your existing Markdown (or MDX, with our optional integration) files as content to [create Markdown or MDX pages](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/markdown-content/).

While file-based routing and layout components are similar in Astro, you may wish to read about [Astro’s project structure](https://docs.astro.build/en/basics/project-structure/) to learn where files should be located.

To convert other types of sites, such as a portfolio or documentation site, see more official starter templates on [astro.new](https://astro.new). You’ll find a link to each project’s GitHub repository, as well as one-click links to open a working project in IDX, StackBlitz, CodeSandbox and Gitpod online development environments.

# Migrating from VuePress

> Tips for migrating an existing VuePress project to Astro

# Migrating from VuePress

[VuePress](https://vuePress.vuejs.org) is an open-source static site generator built on Vue.

## Key Similarities between VuePress and Astro

[Section titled “Key Similarities between VuePress and Astro”](#key-similarities-between-vuepress-and-astro)

VuePress and Astro share some similarities that will help you migrate your project:

- Both VuePress and Astro are modern JavaScript static-site generators with similar project file structures. Both use a [specialsrc/pages/folder for file-based routing](https://docs.astro.build/en/basics/astro-pages/). Creating and managing pages for your site should feel familiar.
- Astro and VuePress are both designed for [content-driven websites](https://docs.astro.build/en/concepts/why-astro/#content-driven), with excellent built-in support for Markdown files. Writing in Markdown will feel familiar, and you will be able to keep your existing content.
- Astro has [an official integration for using Vue components](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/vue/) and supports [installing NPM packages](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/imports/#npm-packages), including several for Vue. You will be able to write Vue UI components, and may be able to keep some or all of your existing Vue components and dependencies.

## Key Differences between VuePress and Astro

[Section titled “Key Differences between VuePress and Astro”](#key-differences-between-vuepress-and-astro)

When you rebuild your VuePress site in Astro, you will notice some important differences.

- VuePress is a Vue-based single-page application (SPA). Astro sites are multi-page apps built using [.astrocomponents](https://docs.astro.build/en/basics/astro-components/), but can also support [React, Preact, Vue.js, Svelte, SolidJS, AlpineJS](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/framework-components/) and raw HTML templating.
- [Layout templates](https://docs.astro.build/en/basics/layouts/): VuePress sites are created using Markdown (`.md`) files for page content and HTML (`.html`) templates for layout. Astro is component-based, and uses Astro components, which include HTML templating for pages, layouts and individual UI elements. Astro can also create [pages from.mdand.mdxfiles](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/markdown-content/), using an Astro layout component for wrapping Markdown content in a page template.
- VuePress was designed to build content-heavy, Markdown-centric sites and has some built-in, documentation-specific website features that you would have to build yourself in Astro. Instead, Astro offers some documentation-specific features through an [official docs theme](https://starlight.astro.build). This website was the inspiration for that template! You can also find more [community docs themes](https://astro.build/themes?search=&categories%5B%5D=docs) with built-in features in our Themes Showcase.

## Switch from VuePress to Astro

[Section titled “Switch from VuePress to Astro”](#switch-from-vuepress-to-astro)

To convert a VuePress documentation site to Astro, start with our official [Starlight docs theme starter template](https://starlight.astro.build), or explore more community docs themes in our [theme showcase](https://astro.build/themes?search=&categories%5B%5D=docs).

You can pass a `--template` argument to the `create astro` command to start a new Astro project with one of our official starters. Or, you can [start a new project from any existing Astro repository on GitHub](https://docs.astro.build/en/install-and-setup/#install-from-the-cli-wizard).

- [Yarn](#tab-panel-3146)

   Terminal window

```
npm create astro@latest -- --template starlight
```

   Terminal window

```
pnpm create astro@latest --template starlight
```

   Terminal window

```
yarn create astro --template starlight
```

Bring your existing Markdown content files to [create Markdown pages](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/markdown-content/). You can still take advantage of [file-based routing](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/routing/) by moving these documents from `docs` in VuePress to `src/pages/` in Astro. Create folders with names that correspond to your existing VuePress project, and you should be able to keep your existing URLs.

VuePress, or any theme you installed, probably handled much of your site layout and metadata for you. You may wish to read about [building Astro Layouts as Markdown page wrappers](https://docs.astro.build/en/basics/layouts/#markdown-layouts) to see how to manage templating yourself in Astro, including your page `<head>`.

You can find Astro’s docs starter, and other templates, on [astro.new](https://astro.new). You’ll find a link to each project’s GitHub repository, as well as one-click links to open a working project in IDX, StackBlitz, CodeSandbox and Gitpod online development environments.

# Migrating from WordPress

> Tips for migrating an existing WordPress project to Astro

# Migrating from WordPress

[WordPress](https://wordpress.org) is an open-source, personal publishing system built on PHP and MySQL.

## Key Similarities between WordPress and Astro

[Section titled “Key Similarities between WordPress and Astro”](#key-similarities-between-wordpress-and-astro)

WordPress and Astro share some similarities that will help you migrate your project:

- Both WordPress and Astro are ideal for [content-driven websites](https://docs.astro.build/en/concepts/why-astro/#content-driven) like blogs and support writing your content in Markdown (requires a plugin in WordPress). Although the process for adding new content is different, [writing in Markdown files](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/markdown-content/) for your Astro blog should feel familiar if you have used Markdown syntax in your WordPress editor.
- Both WordPress and Astro encourage you to [think about the design of your site in “blocks”](https://docs.astro.build/en/concepts/islands/) (components). In Astro you will probably [write more of your own code to create these blocks](https://docs.astro.build/en/basics/astro-components/) rather than rely on pre-built plugins. But thinking about the individual pieces of your site and how they are presented on the page should feel familiar.

## Key Differences between WordPress and Astro

[Section titled “Key Differences between WordPress and Astro”](#key-differences-between-wordpress-and-astro)

When you rebuild your WordPress site in Astro, you will notice some important differences:

- A WordPress site is edited using an online dashboard. In Astro, you will use a [code editor](https://docs.astro.build/en/editor-setup/) and development environment to maintain your site. You can develop locally on your machine, or choose a cloud editor/development environment like IDX, StackBlitz, CodeSandbox or Gitpod.
- WordPress has an extensive plugin and theme market. In Astro, you will find some themes and [integrations](https://astro.build/integrations/) available, but you may now have to build many of your existing features yourself instead of looking for third-party solutions. Or, you can choose to start with an [Astro theme](https://astro.build/themes) with built-in features!
- WordPress stores your content in a database. In Astro, you will have individual files (typically Markdown or MDX) in your [project directory](https://docs.astro.build/en/basics/project-structure/) for each page’s content. Or, you can choose to use a [CMS for your content](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/cms/), even your existing WordPress site, and use Astro to fetch and present the data.

## Switch from WordPress to Astro

[Section titled “Switch from WordPress to Astro”](#switch-from-wordpress-to-astro)

To convert a WordPress blog to Astro, start with our blog theme starter template, or explore more community blog themes in our [theme showcase](https://astro.build/themes).

You can pass a `--template` argument to the `create astro` command to start a new Astro project with one of our official starters. Or, you can [start a new project from any existing Astro repository on GitHub](https://docs.astro.build/en/install-and-setup/#install-from-the-cli-wizard).

- [npm](#tab-panel-3141)
- [pnpm](#tab-panel-3142)
- [Yarn](#tab-panel-3143)

   Terminal window

```
npm create astro@latest -- --template blog
```

   Terminal window

```
pnpm create astro@latest --template blog
```

   Terminal window

```
yarn create astro --template blog
```

You can continue to [use your existing WordPress blog as your CMS for Astro](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/cms/wordpress/), which means you will keep using your WordPress dashboard for writing your posts. Your content will be managed at WordPress, but all other aspects of your Astro site will be built in your code editing environment, and you will [deploy your Astro site](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/deploy/) separately from your WordPress site. (Be sure to update your domain at your host to keep the same website URL!)

You may wish to take [Astro’s Build a Blog Tutorial](https://docs.astro.build/en/tutorial/0-introduction/) if you are new to working in a code editor and using GitHub to store and deploy your site. It will walk you through all the accounts and setup you need! You will also learn how to [build Astro components yourself](https://docs.astro.build/en/tutorial/3-components/), and it will show you how to [add blog posts directly in Astro](https://docs.astro.build/en/tutorial/2-pages/2/) if you choose not to use WordPress to write your content.

If you want to move all of your existing post content to Astro, you may find this [tool for exporting Markdown from WordPress helpful](https://github.com/lonekorean/wordpress-export-to-markdown). You may need to make some adjustments to the result if you have to [convert a large or complicated WordPress site to Markdown](https://swizec.com/blog/how-to-export-a-large-wordpress-site-to-markdown/).

To convert other types of sites, such as a portfolio or documentation site, see more official starter templates on [astro.new](https://astro.new). You’ll find a link to each project’s GitHub repository, as well as one-click links to open a working project in IDX, StackBlitz, CodeSandbox and Gitpod online development environments.

- [CSS stylesheets or libraries](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/styling/) including Tailwind.
- [Markdown/MDX files](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/markdown-content/), configured using your existing [remark and rehype plugins](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/markdown-content/#markdown-plugins).
- [Content from a CMS](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/cms/) through an integration or API.

## Which projects can I convert to Astro?

[Section titled “Which projects can I convert to Astro?”](#which-projects-can-i-convert-to-astro)

[Many existing sites can be built with Astro](https://docs.astro.build/en/concepts/why-astro/). Astro is ideally suited for your existing content-based sites like blogs, landing pages, marketing sites and portfolios. Astro integrates with several popular headless CMSes, and allows you to connect eCommerce shop carts.

Astro allows you have a fully statically-generated website, a dynamic app with routes rendered on demand, or a combination of both with [complete control over your project rendering](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/on-demand-rendering/), making it a great replacement for SSGs or for sites that need to fetch some page data on the fly.

## How will my project design change?

[Section titled “How will my project design change?”](#how-will-my-project-design-change)

Depending on your existing project, you may need to think differently about:

- Designing in [Astro Islands](https://docs.astro.build/en/concepts/islands/#what-is-an-island) to avoid sending unnecessary JavaScript to the browser.
- Providing client-side interactivity with [client-side<script>tags](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/client-side-scripts/) or [UI framework components](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/framework-components/).
- Managing [shared state](https://docs.astro.build/en/recipes/sharing-state-islands/) with Nano Stores or local storage instead of app-wide hooks or wrappers.
