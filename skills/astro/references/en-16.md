# Deploy your Astro Site to AWS

[AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) is a full-featured web app hosting platform that can be used to deploy an Astro site.

Deploying your project to AWS requires using the [AWS console](https://aws.amazon.com/console/). (Most of these actions can also be done using the [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/)). This guide will walk you through the steps to deploy your site to AWS using [AWS Amplify](https://aws.amazon.com/amplify/), [S3 static website hosting](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/), and [CloudFront](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/).

## AWS Amplify

[Section titled “AWS Amplify”](#aws-amplify)

AWS Amplify is a set of purpose-built tools and features that lets frontend web and mobile developers quickly and easily build full-stack applications on AWS. You can either deploy your Astro project as a static site, or as a server-rendered site.

### Static Site

[Section titled “Static Site”](#static-site)

Your Astro project is a static site by default.

1. Create a new Amplify Hosting project.
2. Connect your repository to Amplify.
3. Modify your build settings to match your project’s build process.
  - [npm](#tab-panel-2807)
  - [pnpm](#tab-panel-2808)
  - [Yarn](#tab-panel-2809)
  ```
  version: 1frontend:  phases:    preBuild:      commands:        - npm ci    build:      commands:        - npm run build  artifacts:    baseDirectory: /dist    files:      - '**/*'  cache:    paths:      - node_modules/**/*
  ```
  ```
  version: 1frontend:  phases:    preBuild:      commands:        - npm i -g pnpm        - pnpm config set store-dir .pnpm-store        - pnpm i    build:      commands:        - pnpm run build  artifacts:    baseDirectory: /dist    files:      - '**/*'  cache:    paths:      - .pnpm-store/**/*
  ```
  ```
  version: 1frontend:  phases:    preBuild:      commands:        - yarn install    build:      commands:        - yarn build  artifacts:    baseDirectory: /dist    files:      - '**/*'  cache:    paths:      - node_modules/**/*
  ```

Amplify will automatically deploy your website and update it when you push a commit to your repository.

### Adapter for on-demand rendering

[Section titled “Adapter for on-demand rendering”](#adapter-for-on-demand-rendering)

In order to deploy your project as a server-rendered site, you will need to use the third-party, [community-maintained AWS Amplify adapter](https://github.com/alexnguyennz/astro-aws-amplify) and make some changes to your config.

First, install the Amplify adapter.

- [npm](#tab-panel-2810)
- [pnpm](#tab-panel-2811)
- [Yarn](#tab-panel-2812)

   Terminal window

```
npm install astro-aws-amplify
```

   Terminal window

```
pnpm add astro-aws-amplify
```

   Terminal window

```
yarn add astro-aws-amplify
```

Then, in your `astro.config.*` file, add the adapter and set the output to `server`.

 astro.config.mjs

```
import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';import awsAmplify from 'astro-aws-amplify';
export default defineConfig({  // ...  output: "server",  adapter: awsAmplify(),});
```

Once the adapter has been installed, you can set up your Amplify project.

1. Create a new Amplify Hosting project.
2. Connect your repository to Amplify.
3. Modify your build settings to match the adapter’s build process by either editing the build settings in the AWS console, or by adding an `amplify.yaml` in the root of your project.
  - [npm](#tab-panel-2813)
  - [pnpm](#tab-panel-2814)
  - [Yarn](#tab-panel-2815)
  ```
  version: 1frontend:  phases:    preBuild:      commands:        - npm ci --cache .npm --prefer-offline    build:      commands:        - npm run build        - mv node_modules ./.amplify-hosting/compute/default  artifacts:    baseDirectory: .amplify-hosting    files:      - '**/*'  cache:    paths:      - .npm/**/*
  ```
  ```
  version: 1frontend:  phases:    preBuild:      commands:        - npm i -g pnpm        - pnpm config set store-dir .pnpm-store        - pnpm i    build:      commands:        - pnpm run build        - mv node_modules ./.amplify-hosting/compute/default  artifacts:    baseDirectory: .amplify-hosting    files:      - '**/*'  cache:    paths:      - .pnpm-store/**/*
  ```
  ```
  version: 1frontend:  phases:    preBuild:      commands:        - yarn install    build:      commands:        - yarn build        - mv node_modules ./.amplify-hosting/compute/default  artifacts:    baseDirectory: .amplify-hosting    files:      - '**/*'  cache:    paths:      - node_modules/**/*
  ```

Amplify will automatically deploy your website and update it when you push a commit to your repository.

See [AWS’s Astro deployment guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amplify/latest/userguide/get-started-astro.html) for more info.

## S3 static website hosting

[Section titled “S3 static website hosting”](#s3-static-website-hosting)

S3 is the starting point of any application. It is where your project files and other assets are stored. S3 charges for file storage and number of requests. You can find more information about S3 in the [AWS documentation](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/).

1. Create an S3 bucket with your project’s name.
2. Disable **“Block all public access”**. By default, AWS sets all buckets to be private. To make it public, you need to uncheck the “Block public access” checkbox in the bucket’s properties.
3. Upload your built files located in `dist` to S3. You can do this manually in the console or use the AWS CLI. If you use the AWS CLI, use the following command after [authenticating with your AWS credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-files.html):
  ```
  aws s3 cp dist/ s3://<BUCKET_NAME>/ --recursive
  ```
4. Update your bucket policy to allow public access. You can find this setting in the bucket’s **Permissions > Bucket policy**.
  ```
  {  "Version": "2012-10-17",  "Statement": [    {      "Sid": "PublicReadGetObject",      "Effect": "Allow",      "Principal": "*",      "Action": "s3:GetObject",      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::<BUCKET_NAME>/*"    }  ]}
  ```
5. Enable website hosting for your bucket. You can find this setting in the bucket’s **Properties > Static website hosting**. Set your index document to `index.html` and your error document to `404.html`. Finally, you can find your new website URL in the bucket’s **Properties > Static website hosting**.

## S3 with CloudFront

[Section titled “S3 with CloudFront”](#s3-with-cloudfront)

CloudFront is a web service that provides content delivery network (CDN) capabilities. It is used to cache content of a web server and distribute it to end users. CloudFront charges for the amount of data transferred. Adding CloudFront to your S3 bucket is more cost-effective and provides a faster delivery.

To connect S3 with CloudFront, create a CloudFront distribution with the following values:

- **Origin domain:** Your S3 bucket static website endpoint. You can find your endpoint in your S3 bucket’s **Properties > Static website hosting**. Alternative, you can select your s3 bucket and click on the callout to replace your bucket address with your bucket static endpoint.
- **Viewer protocol policy:** “Redirect to HTTPS”

This configuration will serve your site using the CloudFront CDN network. You can find your CloudFront distribution URL in the bucket’s **Distributions > Domain name**.

## Continuous deployment with GitHub Actions

[Section titled “Continuous deployment with GitHub Actions”](#continuous-deployment-with-github-actions)

There are many ways to set up continuous deployment for AWS. One possibility for code hosted on GitHub is to use [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) to deploy your website every time you push a commit.

1. Create a new policy in your AWS account using [IAM](https://aws.amazon.com/iam/) with the following permissions. This policy will allow you to upload built files to your S3 bucket and invalidate the CloudFront distribution files when you push a commit.
  ```
  {  "Version": "2012-10-17",  "Statement": [      {          "Sid": "VisualEditor0",          "Effect": "Allow",          "Action": [              "s3:PutObject",              "s3:ListBucket",              "s3:DeleteObject",              "cloudfront:CreateInvalidation"          ],          "Resource": [              "<DISTRIBUTION_ARN>",              "arn:aws:s3:::<BUCKET_NAME>/*",              "arn:aws:s3:::<BUCKET_NAME>"          ]      }  ]}
  ```
2. Create a new IAM user and attach the policy to the user. This will provide your `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` and `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`.
3. Add this sample workflow to your repository at `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` and push it to GitHub. You will need to add `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `BUCKET_ID`, and `DISTRIBUTION_ID` as “secrets” to your repository on GitHub under **Settings** > **Secrets** > **Actions**. Click New repository secret to add each one.
  ```
  name: Deploy Website
  on:  push:    branches:      - main
  jobs:  deploy:    runs-on: ubuntu-latest    steps:      - name: Checkout        uses: actions/checkout@v4      - name: Configure AWS Credentials        uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v1        with:          aws-access-key-id: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}          aws-secret-access-key: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}          aws-region: us-east-1      - name: Install modules        run: npm ci      - name: Build application        run: npm run build      - name: Deploy to S3        run: aws s3 sync --delete ./dist/ s3://${{ secrets.BUCKET_ID }}      - name: Create CloudFront invalidation        run: aws cloudfront create-invalidation --distribution-id ${{ secrets.DISTRIBUTION_ID }} --paths "/*"
  ```

Building your Edge Application. This process may take a few minutesRunning build step command:...
```

Then, when the build is complete, the access to the application is prompted:

 Terminal window

```
[Azion Bundler] [Server] › ✔  success   Function running on port http://localhost:3000
```

## Troubleshooting

[Section titled “Troubleshooting”](#troubleshooting)

### Node.js runtime APIs

[Section titled “Node.js runtime APIs”](#nodejs-runtime-apis)

A project using an NPM package fails to build with an error message such as `[Error] Could not resolve "XXXX. The package "XXXX" wasn't found on the file system but is built into node.`:

This means that a package or import you are using is not compatible with Azion’s runtime APIs.

If you are directly importing a Node.js runtime API, please refer to the [Azion Node.js compatibility](https://www.azion.com/en/documentation/products/azion-edge-runtime/compatibility/node/) for further steps on how to resolve this.

If you are importing a package that imports a Node.js runtime API, check with the author of the package to see if they support the `node:*` import syntax. If they do not, you may need to find an alternative package.

# Deploy your Astro Site to Clever Cloud

> How to deploy your Astro site to the web on Clever Cloud.

# Deploy your Astro Site to Clever Cloud

[Clever Cloud](https://clever-cloud.com) is a European cloud platform that provides automated, scalable services.

## Project Configuration

[Section titled “Project Configuration”](#project-configuration)

You can deploy both fully static and on-demand rendered Astro projects on Clever Cloud. Regardless of your `output` mode (pre-rendered or [on-demand](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/on-demand-rendering/)), you can choose to deploy as a **static application** which runs using a post-build hook, or as a **Node.js** application, which requires some manual configuration in your `package.json`.

### Scripts

[Section titled “Scripts”](#scripts)

If you’re running an on-demand Node.js application, update your `start` script to run the Node server. Applications on Clever Cloud listen on port **8080**.

 package.json

```
"scripts": {  "start": "node ./dist/server/entry.mjs --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080",}
```

## Deploy Astro from the Console

[Section titled “Deploy Astro from the Console”](#deploy-astro-from-the-console)

To deploy your Astro project to Clever Cloud, you will need to **create a new application**. The application wizard will walk you through the necessary configuration steps.

1. From the lateral menubar, click **Create** > **An application**
2. Choose how to deploy:
  - **Create a brand new app**: to deploy from a local repository with Git
  or
  - **Select a GitHub repository**: to deploy from GitHub
3. Select a **Node.js** application, or a **static** one.
4. Set up the minimal size for your instance and scalability options. Astro sites can typically be deployed using the **Nano** instance. Depending on your project’s specifications and dependencies, you may need to adjust accordingly as you watch the metrics from the **Overview** page.
5. Select a **region** to deploy your instance.
6. Skip [connectingAdd-onsto your Clever application](https://www.clever-cloud.com/developers/doc/addons/) unless you’re using a database or Keycloak.
7. Inject **environment variables**:
  - For **Node.js**, set the following environment variables based on your package manager:
  - [npm](#tab-panel-2816)
  - [pnpm](#tab-panel-2817)
  - [Yarn](#tab-panel-2818)
     Terminal window
  ```
  CC_NODE_BUILD_TOOL="npm"CC_PRE_BUILD_HOOK="npm install && npm run astro telemetry disable && npm run build"
  ```
     Terminal window
  ```
  CC_NODE_BUILD_TOOL="custom"CC_PRE_BUILD_HOOK="npm install -g pnpm && pnpm install"CC_CUSTOM_BUILD_TOOL="pnpm run astro telemetry disable && pnpm build"
  ```
     Terminal window
  ```
  CC_NODE_BUILD_TOOL="yarn"CC_PRE_BUILD_HOOK="yarn && yarn run astro telemetry disable && yarn build"
  ```
  - For a **static** application, add these variables:
  - [npm](#tab-panel-2819)
  - [pnpm](#tab-panel-2820)
  - [Yarn](#tab-panel-2821)
     Terminal window
  ```
  CC_POST_BUILD_HOOK="npm run build"CC_PRE_BUILD_HOOK="npm install && npm run astro telemetry disable"CC_WEBROOT="/dist"
  ```
     Terminal window
  ```
  CC_POST_BUILD_HOOK="pnpm build"CC_PRE_BUILD_HOOK="npm install -g pnpm && pnpm install && pnpm run astro telemetry disable"CC_WEBROOT="/dist"
  ```
     Terminal window
  ```
  CC_POST_BUILD_HOOK="yarn build"CC_PRE_BUILD_HOOK="yarn && yarn run astro telemetry disable"CC_WEBROOT="/dist"
  ```
8. **Deploy!** If you’re deploying from **GitHub**, your deployment should start automatically. If you’re using **Git**, copy the remote and push on the **master** branch.

# Deploy your Astro Site to Cloudflare

> How to deploy your Astro site to the web using Cloudflare

# Deploy your Astro Site to Cloudflare

You can deploy full-stack applications, including front-end static assets and back-end APIs, as well as on-demand rendered sites, to both [Cloudflare Workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/static-assets/) and [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/).

This guide includes:

- [How to deploy to Cloudflare Workers](#cloudflare-workers)
- [How to deploy to Cloudflare Pages](#cloudflare-pages)

    Read more about [using the Cloudflare runtime](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/cloudflare/) in your Astro project.

## Prerequisites

[Section titled “Prerequisites”](#prerequisites)

To get started, you will need:

- A Cloudflare account. If you don’t already have one, you can create a free Cloudflare account during the process.

## Cloudflare Workers

[Section titled “Cloudflare Workers”](#cloudflare-workers)

### How to deploy with Wrangler

[Section titled “How to deploy with Wrangler”](#how-to-deploy-with-wrangler)

1. Install [Wrangler CLI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/get-started/).
   Terminal window
  ```
  npm install wrangler@latest --save-dev
  ```
2. If your site uses on-demand rendering, install the [@astrojs/cloudflareadapter](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/cloudflare/).
  This will install the adapter and make the appropriate changes to your `astro.config.mjs` file in one step.
  - [npm](#tab-panel-2826)
  - [pnpm](#tab-panel-2827)
  - [Yarn](#tab-panel-2828)
     Terminal window
  ```
  npx astro add cloudflare
  ```
     Terminal window
  ```
  pnpm astro add cloudflare
  ```
     Terminal window
  ```
  yarn astro add cloudflare
  ```
        Read more about [on-demand rendering in Astro](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/on-demand-rendering/).
3. Create a [Wrangler configuration file](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/configuration/).
  Running `astro add cloudflare` will create this for you; if you are not using the adapter, you’ll need to create it yourself.
  - [Static](#tab-panel-2822)
  - [On demand](#tab-panel-2823)
     wrangler.jsonc
  ```
  {  "name": "my-astro-app",  "compatibility_date": "YYYY-MM-DD", // Update to the day you deploy  "assets": {    "directory": "./dist",  }}
  ```
     wrangler.jsonc
  ```
  {  "main": "dist/_worker.js/index.js",  "name": "my-astro-app",  "compatibility_date": "YYYY-MM-DD", // Update to the day you deploy  "compatibility_flags": [    "nodejs_compat",    "global_fetch_strictly_public"  ],  "assets": {    "binding": "ASSETS",    "directory": "./dist"  },  "observability": {    "enabled": true  }}
  ```
4. Preview your project locally with Wrangler.
   Terminal window
  ```
  npx astro build && npx wrangler dev
  ```
5. Deploy using `npx wrangler deploy`.
   Terminal window
  ```
  npx astro build && npx wrangler deploy
  ```

After your assets are uploaded, Wrangler will give you a preview URL to inspect your site.

   Read more about using [Cloudflare runtime APIs](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/cloudflare/) such as bindings.

### How to deploy with CI/CD

[Section titled “How to deploy with CI/CD”](#how-to-deploy-with-cicd)

You can also use a CI/CD system such as [Workers Builds (BETA)](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/ci-cd/builds/) to automatically build and deploy your site on push.

If you’re using Workers Builds:

1. Follow Steps 1-3 from the Wrangler section above.
2. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/) and navigate to `Workers & Pages`. Select `Create`.
3. Under `Import a repository`, select a Git account and then the repository containing your Astro project.
4. Configure your project with:
  - Build command: `npx astro build`
  - Deploy command: `npx wrangler deploy`
5. Click `Save and Deploy`. You can now preview your Worker at its provided `workers.dev` subdomain.

## Cloudflare Pages

[Section titled “Cloudflare Pages”](#cloudflare-pages)

### How to deploy with Wrangler

[Section titled “How to deploy with Wrangler”](#how-to-deploy-with-wrangler-1)

1. Install [Wrangler CLI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/get-started/).
  - [npm](#tab-panel-2829)
  - [pnpm](#tab-panel-2830)
  - [Yarn](#tab-panel-2831)
     Terminal window
  ```
  npm install wrangler@latest --save-dev
  ```
     Terminal window
  ```
  pnpm add wrangler@latest --save-dev
  ```
     Terminal window
  ```
  yarn add wrangler@latest --dev
  ```
2. If your site uses on-demand rendering, install the [@astrojs/cloudflareadapter](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/cloudflare/).
  This will install the adapter and make the appropriate changes to your `astro.config.mjs` file in one step.
  - [npm](#tab-panel-2832)
  - [pnpm](#tab-panel-2833)
  - [Yarn](#tab-panel-2834)
     Terminal window
  ```
  npx astro add cloudflare
  ```
     Terminal window
  ```
  pnpm astro add cloudflare
  ```
     Terminal window
  ```
  yarn astro add cloudflare
  ```
3. Create a [Wrangler configuration file](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/configuration/).
  Because Cloudflare recommends new projects use Workers instead of Pages, the `astro add cloudflare` command creates a `wrangler.jsonc` and `public/.assetsignore` file, which are specific to Workers projects. You will need to delete the `public/.assetsignore` file and change your `wrangler.jsonc` file. If you are not using the adapter you’ll need to create it yourself.
  Ensure your `wrangler.jsonc` file is structured like this:
  - [Static](#tab-panel-2824)
  - [On demand](#tab-panel-2825)
     wrangler.jsonc
  ```
  {  "name": "my-astro-app",  "compatibility_date": "YYYY-MM-DD", // Update to the day you deploy  "pages_build_output_dir": "./dist"}
  ```
     wrangler.jsonc
  ```
  {  "name": "my-astro-app",  "compatibility_date": "YYYY-MM-DD", // Update to the day you deploy  "compatibility_flags": [    "nodejs_compat",    "disable_nodejs_process_v2"  ],  "pages_build_output_dir": "./dist"}
  ```
        Read more about [on-demand rendering in Astro](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/on-demand-rendering/).
4. Preview your project locally with Wrangler.
  - [npm](#tab-panel-2835)
  - [pnpm](#tab-panel-2836)
  - [Yarn](#tab-panel-2837)
     Terminal window
  ```
  npx astro build && wrangler pages dev ./dist
  ```
     Terminal window
  ```
  pnpm astro build && wrangler pages dev ./dist
  ```
     Terminal window
  ```
  yarn astro build && wrangler pages dev ./dist
  ```
5. Deploy using `npx wrangler deploy`.
  - [npm](#tab-panel-2838)
  - [pnpm](#tab-panel-2839)
  - [Yarn](#tab-panel-2840)
     Terminal window
  ```
  npx astro build && wrangler pages deploy ./dist
  ```
     Terminal window
  ```
  pnpm astro build && wrangler pages deploy ./dist
  ```
     Terminal window
  ```
  yarn astro build && wrangler pages deploy ./dist
  ```

After your assets are uploaded, Wrangler will give you a preview URL to inspect your site.

### How to deploy a site with CI/CD

[Section titled “How to deploy a site with CI/CD”](#how-to-deploy-a-site-with-cicd)

1. Push your code to your git repository (e.g. GitHub, GitLab).
2. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/) and navigate to **Compute (Workers) > Workers & Pages**. Select **Create** and then select the **Pages** tab. Connect your git repository.
3. Configure your project with:
  - **Framework preset**: `Astro`
  - **Build command:** `npm run build`
  - **Build output directory:** `dist`
4. Click the **Save and Deploy** button.

## Troubleshooting

[Section titled “Troubleshooting”](#troubleshooting)

### 404 behavior

[Section titled “404 behavior”](#404-behavior)

For Workers projects, you will need to set `not_found_handling` if you want to serve a custom 404 page. You can read more about this in the [Routing behavior section](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/static-assets/#routing-behavior) of Cloudflare’s documentation.

 wrangler.jsonc

```
{  "assets": {    "directory": "./dist",    "not_found_handling": "404-page"  }}
```

For Pages projects, if you include a custom 404 page, it will be served by default. Otherwise, Pages will default to [Cloudflare’s single-page application rendering behavior](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/configuration/serving-pages/#single-page-application-spa-rendering) and redirect to the home page instead of showing a 404 page.

### Client-side hydration

[Section titled “Client-side hydration”](#client-side-hydration)

Client-side hydration may fail as a result of Cloudflare’s Auto Minify setting. If you see `Hydration completed but contains mismatches` in the console, make sure to disable Auto Minify under Cloudflare settings.

### Node.js runtime APIs

[Section titled “Node.js runtime APIs”](#nodejs-runtime-apis)

If you are building a project that is using on-demand rendering with [the Cloudflare adapter](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/cloudflare/) and the server fails to build with an error message such as `[Error] Could not resolve "XXXX. The package "XXXX" wasn't found on the file system but is built into node.`:

- This means that a package or import you are using in the server-side environment is not compatible with the [Cloudflare runtime APIs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/nodejs/).
- If you are directly importing a Node.js runtime API, please refer to the Astro documentation on Cloudflare’s [Node.js compatibility](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/cloudflare/#nodejs-compatibility) for further steps on how to resolve this.
- If you are importing a package that imports a Node.js runtime API, check with the author of the package to see if they support the `node:*` import syntax. If they do not, you may need to find an alternative package.

# Deploy your Astro Site with CloudRay

> How to deploy your Astro site to your Ubuntu Server using CloudRay

# Deploy your Astro Site with CloudRay

You can deploy your Astro project using [CloudRay](https://cloudray.io), a centralized platform that helps you manage your servers, organize Bash scripts, and automate deployment tasks across virtual machines and cloud servers.

## Prerequisites

[Section titled “Prerequisites”](#prerequisites)

To get started, you will need:

- A [CloudRay Account](https://app.cloudray.io)
- Your app code stored in a [GitHub](https://github.com/) repository

## How to Deploy through CloudRay Dashboard

[Section titled “How to Deploy through CloudRay Dashboard”](#how-to-deploy-through-cloudray-dashboard)

Deploying with CloudRay typically involves three main steps:

1. Install the [CloudRay Agent](https://cloudray.io/docs/agent) on your server to securely register your machine and enable remote automation.
2. In your CloudRay Dashboard, write a reusable Bash script that clones your Astro repo, installs dependencies, builds your site, and configures a web server. Define any repo-specific values using [CloudRay’s variable groups](https://cloudray.io/docs/variable-groups).
3. Use CloudRay’s Runlog interface to execute your script on your connected server and monitor the deployment in real time.

## Official Resources
