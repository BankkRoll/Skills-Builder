# Migrating from Eleventy

[Eleventy](https://11ty.dev) is an open-source static site generator that works with multiple template languages.

## Key Similarities between Eleventy (11ty) and Astro

[Section titled “Key Similarities between Eleventy (11ty) and Astro”](#key-similarities-between-eleventy-11ty-and-astro)

Eleventy (11ty) and Astro share some similarities that will help you migrate your project:

- Both Astro and Eleventy are modern, JavaScript-based (Jamstack) site builders.
- Astro and Eleventy both allow you to use a [headless CMS, APIs or Markdown files for data](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/data-fetching/). You can continue to use your preferred content authoring system, and will be able to keep your existing content.

## Key Differences between Eleventy (11ty) and Astro

[Section titled “Key Differences between Eleventy (11ty) and Astro”](#key-differences-between-eleventy-11ty-and-astro)

When you rebuild your Eleventy (11ty) site in Astro, you will notice some important differences:

- Eleventy supports a variety of templating languages. Astro supports [including components from several popular JS Frameworks (e.g. React, Svelte, Vue, Solid)](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/framework-components/), but uses [Astro layouts, pages and components](https://docs.astro.build/en/basics/astro-components/) for most page templating.
- Astro uses a [src/directory](https://docs.astro.build/en/basics/project-structure/#src) for all files, including site metadata, that are available for querying and processing during site build. Within this is a [specialsrc/pages/folder for file-based routing](https://docs.astro.build/en/basics/astro-pages/).
- Astro uses a [public/folder for static assets](https://docs.astro.build/en/basics/project-structure/#public) that do not need to be processed nor transformed during the build.
- In Eleventy, bundling CSS, JavaScript, and other assets needs to be configured manually. [Astro handles this for you out-of-the-box](https://docs.astro.build/en/concepts/why-astro/#easy-to-use).

## Switch from Eleventy to Astro

[Section titled “Switch from Eleventy to Astro”](#switch-from-eleventy-to-astro)

To convert an Eleventy blog to Astro, start with our blog theme starter template, or explore more community blog themes in our [theme showcase](https://astro.build/themes/).

You can pass a `--template` argument to the `create astro` command to start a new Astro project with one of our official starters. Or, you can [start a new project from any existing Astro repository on GitHub](https://docs.astro.build/en/install-and-setup/#install-from-the-cli-wizard).

- [npm](#tab-panel-3105)
- [pnpm](#tab-panel-3106)
- [Yarn](#tab-panel-3107)

   Terminal window

```
npm create astro@latest -- --template blog
```

   Terminal window

```
pnpm create astro@latest --template blog
```

   Terminal window

```
yarn create astro --template blog
```

Bring your existing Markdown (or MDX, with our optional integration) files as content to [create Markdown or MDX pages](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/markdown-content/).

Your Eleventy project allowed you to use a variety of templating languages to build your site. In an Astro project, your page templating will mostly be achieved with Astro components, which can be used as UI elements, layouts and even full pages. You may want to explore [Astro’s component syntax](https://docs.astro.build/en/basics/astro-components/) to see how to template in Astro using components.

To convert other types of sites, such as a portfolio or documentation site, see more official starter templates on [astro.new](https://astro.new). You’ll find a link to each project’s GitHub repository, as well as one-click links to open a working project in IDX, StackBlitz, CodeSandbox and Gitpod online development environments.

# Migrating from Gatsby

> Tips for migrating an existing Gatsby project to Astro

# Migrating from Gatsby

Here are some key concepts and migration strategies to help you get started. Use the rest of our docs and our [Discord community](https://astro.build/chat) to keep going!

## Key Similarities between Gatsby and Astro

[Section titled “Key Similarities between Gatsby and Astro”](#key-similarities-between-gatsby-and-astro)

Gatsby and Astro share some similarities that will help you migrate your project:

- The [syntax of.astrofiles is similar to JSX](https://docs.astro.build/en/reference/astro-syntax/#jsx-like-expressions). Writing Astro should feel familiar.
- Astro has built-in support for [Markdown](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/markdown-content/) and an integration for using MDX files. Also, you can configure and continue to use many of your existing Markdown plugins.
- Astro also has an [official integration for using React components](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/react/). Note that in Astro, React files **must** have a `.jsx` or `.tsx` extension.
- Astro has support for [installing NPM packages](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/imports/#npm-packages), including React libraries. Many of your existing dependencies will work in Astro.
- Like Gatsby, Astro projects can be SSG or [SSR with page-level prerendering](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/on-demand-rendering/).

## Key Differences between Gatsby and Astro

[Section titled “Key Differences between Gatsby and Astro”](#key-differences-between-gatsby-and-astro)

When you rebuild your Gatsby site in Astro, you will notice some important differences:

- Gatsby projects are React single-page apps and use `index.js` as your project’s root. Astro projects are multi-page sites, and `index.astro` is your home page.
- [Astro components](https://docs.astro.build/en/basics/astro-components/) are not written as exported functions that return page templating. Instead, you’ll split your code into a “code fence” for your JavaScript and a body exclusively for the HTML you generate.
- [Local file data](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/imports/): Gatsby uses GraphQL to retrieve data from your project files. Astro uses ESM imports and top-level await functions (e.g. [import.meta.glob()](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/imports/#importmetaglob), [getCollection()](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/#querying-collections)) to import data from your project files. You can manually add GraphQL to your Astro project but it is not included by default.

## Convert your Gatsby Project

[Section titled “Convert your Gatsby Project”](#convert-your-gatsby-project)

Each project migration will look different, but there are some common actions you will perform when converting from Gatsby to Astro.

### Create a new Astro project

[Section titled “Create a new Astro project”](#create-a-new-astro-project)

Use the `create astro` command for your package manager to launch Astro’s CLI wizard or choose a community theme from the [Astro Theme Showcase](https://astro.build/themes).

You can pass a `--template` argument to the `create astro` command to start a new Astro project with one of our official starters (e.g. `docs`, `blog`, `portfolio`). Or, you can [start a new project from any existing Astro repository on GitHub](https://docs.astro.build/en/install-and-setup/#install-from-the-cli-wizard).

- [npm](#tab-panel-3110)
- [pnpm](#tab-panel-3111)
- [Yarn](#tab-panel-3112)

   Terminal window

```
# launch the Astro CLI Wizardnpm create astro@latest
# create a new project with an official examplenpm create astro@latest -- --template <example-name>
```

   Terminal window

```
# launch the Astro CLI Wizardpnpm create astro@latest
# create a new project with an official examplepnpm create astro@latest --template <example-name>
```

   Terminal window

```
# launch the Astro CLI Wizardyarn create astro@latest
# create a new project with an official exampleyarn create astro@latest --template <example-name>
```

Then, copy your existing Gatsby project files over to your new Astro project into a separate folder outside of `src`.

### Install integrations (optional)

[Section titled “Install integrations (optional)”](#install-integrations-optional)

You may find it useful to install some of [Astro’s optional integrations](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/) to use while converting your Gatsby project to Astro:

- **@astrojs/react**: to reuse some existing React UI components in your new Astro site or keep writing with React components.
- **@astrojs/mdx**: to bring existing MDX files from your Gatsby project, or to use MDX in your new Astro site.

### Put your code insrc

[Section titled “Put your code in src”](#put-your-code-in-src)

Following [Astro’s project structure](https://docs.astro.build/en/basics/project-structure/):

1. **Delete** Gatsby’s `public/` folder.
  Gatsby uses the `public/` directory for its build output, so you can safely discard this folder. You will no longer need a built version of your Gatsby site. (Astro uses `dist/` by default for the build output.)
2. **Rename** Gatsby’s `static/` folder to `public/`, and use it as Astro’s `public/` folder.
  Astro uses a folder called `public/` for static assets. You can alternatively copy the contents of `static/` into your existing Astro `public/` folder.
3. **Copy or Move** Gatsby’s other files and folders (e.g. `components`, `pages`, etc.) as needed into your Astro `src/` folder as you rebuild your site, following [Astro’s project structure](https://docs.astro.build/en/basics/project-structure/).
  Astro’s `src/pages/` folder is a special folder used for file-based routing to create your site’s pages and posts from `.astro`, `.md` and `.mdx` files. You will not have to configure any routing behavior for your Astro, Markdown, and MDX files.
  All other folders are optional, and you can organize the contents of your `src/` folder any way you like. Other common folders in Astro projects include `src/layouts/`, `src/components`, `src/styles`, and `src/scripts`.

### Tips: Convert JSX files to.astrofiles

[Section titled “Tips: Convert JSX files to .astro files”](#tips-convert-jsx-files-to-astro-files)

Here are some tips for converting a Gatsby `.js` component into a `.astro` component:

1. Use only the `return()` of the existing Gatsby component function as your HTML template.
2. Change any [Gatsby or JSX syntax to Astro syntax](#reference-convert-to-astro-syntax) or to HTML web standards. This includes `<Link to="">`, `{children}`, and `className`, for example.
3. Move any necessary JavaScript, including import statements, into a [“code fence” (---)](https://docs.astro.build/en/basics/astro-components/#the-component-script). Note: JavaScript to [conditionally render content](https://docs.astro.build/en/reference/astro-syntax/#dynamic-html) is often written inside the HTML template directly in Astro.
4. Use [Astro.props](https://docs.astro.build/en/reference/api-reference/#props) to access any additional props that were previously passed to your Gatsby function.
5. Decide whether any imported components also need to be converted to Astro. With the official React integration installed, you can [use existing React components in your Astro files](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/framework-components/). But, you may want to convert them to `.astro` components, especially if they do not need to be interactive!
6. Remove any GraphQL queries. Instead, use import and [import.meta.glob()](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/imports/#importmetaglob) statements to query your local files.

See [an example from Gatsby’s Blog starter template converted step-by-step](#guided-example-gatsby-layout-to-astro)

#### Compare:.jsxvs.astro

[Section titled “Compare: .jsx vs .astro”](#compare-jsx-vs-astro)

Compare the following Gatsby component and a corresponding Astro component:

- [JSX](#tab-panel-3108)
- [Astro](#tab-panel-3109)

   component.jsx

```
import * as React from "react"import { useStaticQuery, graphql } from "gatsby"import Header from "./header"import Footer from "./footer"import "./layout.css"
const Component = ({ message, children }) => {  const data = useStaticQuery(graphql`    query SiteTitleQuery {      site {        siteMetadata {          title        }      }    }  `)  return (    <>      <Header siteTitle={data.site.siteMetadata.title} />      <div style={{ margin: `0`, maxWidth: `960`}}>{message}</div>      <main>{children}</main>      <Footer siteTitle={data.site.siteMetadata} />    </>  )}
export default Component
```

   component.astro

```
---import Header from "./Header.astro"import Footer from "./Footer.astro"import "../styles/stylesheet.css"import { site } from "../data/siteMetaData.js"const { message } = Astro.props---<Header siteTitle={site.title} />  <div style="margin: 0; max-width: 960;">{message}</div>  <main>    <slot />  </main><Footer siteTitle={site.title} />
```

### Migrating Layout Files

[Section titled “Migrating Layout Files”](#migrating-layout-files)

You may find it helpful to start by converting your Gatsby layouts and templates into [Astro layout components](https://docs.astro.build/en/basics/layouts/).

Each Astro page explicitly requires `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` tags to be present, so it is common to reuse a layout file across pages. Astro uses a [<slot />](https://docs.astro.build/en/basics/astro-components/#slots) instead of React’s `{children}` prop for page content, with no import statement required. Your Gatsby `layout.js` and templates will not include these.

Note the standard HTML templating, and direct access to `<head>`:

 src/layouts/Layout.astro

```
<html lang="en">  <head>    <meta charset="utf-8" />    <link rel="icon" type="image/svg+xml" href="/favicon.svg" />    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width" />    <title>Astro</title>  </head>  <body>        <slot />  </body></html>
```

You may also wish to reuse code from Gatsby’s `src/components/seo.js` to include additional site metadata. Notice that Astro uses neither `<Helmet>` nor `<Header>` but instead creates `<head>` directly. You may import and use components, even within `<head>`, to separate and organize your page content.

### Migrating Pages and Posts

[Section titled “Migrating Pages and Posts”](#migrating-pages-and-posts)

In Gatsby, your [pages and posts](https://docs.astro.build/en/basics/astro-pages/) may exist in `src/pages/` or outside of `src` in another folder, like `content`. In Astro, all your page content must live within `src/` unless you are using [content collections](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/).

#### React Pages

[Section titled “React Pages”](#react-pages)

Your existing Gatsby JSX (`.js`) pages will need to be [converted from JSX files to.astropages](#tips-convert-jsx-files-to-astro-files). You cannot use an existing JSX page file in Astro.

These [.astropages](https://docs.astro.build/en/basics/astro-pages/) must be located within `src/pages/` and will have page routes generated automatically based on their file path.

#### Markdown and MDX pages

[Section titled “Markdown and MDX pages”](#markdown-and-mdx-pages)

Astro has built-in support for Markdown and an optional integration for MDX files. Your existing [Markdown and MDX files](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/markdown-content/) can be reused but may require some adjustments to their frontmatter, such as adding [Astro’s speciallayoutfrontmatter property](https://docs.astro.build/en/basics/layouts/#markdown-layouts). They can also be placed within `src/pages/` to take advantage of automatic file-based routing.

Alternatively, you can use [content collections](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/) in Astro to store and manage your content. You will retrieve the content yourself and [generate those pages dynamically](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/#generating-routes-from-content).

### Migrating Tests

[Section titled “Migrating Tests”](#migrating-tests)

As Astro outputs raw HTML, it is possible to write end-to-end tests using the output of the build step. Any end-to-end tests written previously might work out-of-the-box if you have been able to match the markup of the older Gatsby site. Testing libraries such as Jest and React Testing Library can be imported and used in Astro to test your React components.

See Astro’s [testing guide](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/testing/) for more.

### Repurpose config files

[Section titled “Repurpose config files”](#repurpose-config-files)

Gatsby has several top-level configuration files that also include site and page metadata and are used for routing. You will not use any of these `gatsby-*.js` files in your Astro project, but there may be some content that you can reuse as you build your Astro project:

- `gatsby-config.js`: Move your `siteMetadata: {}` into `src/data/siteMetadata.js` (or `siteMetadata.json`) to import data about your site (title, description, social accounts, etc.) into page layouts.
- `gatsby-browser.js`: Consider adding anything used here directly into your [main layout](#migrating-layout-files)’s `<head>` tag.
- `gatsby-node.js`: You will not need to create your own nodes in Astro, but viewing the schema in this file may help you with defining types in your Astro project.
- `gatsby-ssr.js`: If you choose to use SSR in Astro, you will [add and configure the SSR adapter](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/on-demand-rendering/) of your choice directly in `astro.config.mjs`.

## Reference: Convert to Astro Syntax

[Section titled “Reference: Convert to Astro Syntax”](#reference-convert-to-astro-syntax)

The following are some examples of Gatsby-specific syntax that you will need to convert to Astro. See more [differences between Astro and JSX](https://docs.astro.build/en/reference/astro-syntax/#differences-between-astro-and-jsx) in the guide to writing Astro components.

### Gatsby Links to Astro

[Section titled “Gatsby Links to Astro”](#gatsby-links-to-astro)

Convert any Gatsby `<Link to="">`, `<NavLink>` etc. components to HTML `<a href="">` tags.

```
<Link to="/blog">Blog</Link><a href="/blog">Blog</a>
```

Astro does not use any special component for links, although you are welcome to build your own `<Link>` component. You can then import and use this `<Link>` just as you would any other component.

 src/components/Link.astro

```
---const { to } = Astro.props---<a href={to}><slot /></a>
```

### Gatsby Imports to Astro

[Section titled “Gatsby Imports to Astro”](#gatsby-imports-to-astro)

If necessary, update any [file imports](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/imports/) to reference relative file paths exactly. This can be done using [import aliases](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/typescript/#import-aliases), or by writing out a relative path in full.

Note that `.astro` and several other file types must be imported with their full file extension.

 src/pages/authors/Fred.astro

```
---import Card from `../../components/Card.astro`;---<Card />
```

### Gatsby Children Props to Astro

[Section titled “Gatsby Children Props to Astro”](#gatsby-children-props-to-astro)

Convert any instances of `{children}` to an Astro `<slot />`. Astro does not need to receive `{children}` as a function prop and will automatically render child content in a `<slot />`.

 src/components/MyComponent

```
------export default function MyComponent(props) {    return (      <div>        {props.children}      </div>    );}
<div>  <slot /></div>
```

React components that pass multiple sets of children can be migrated to an Astro component using [named slots](https://docs.astro.build/en/basics/astro-components/#named-slots).

See more about [specific<slot />usage in Astro](https://docs.astro.build/en/basics/astro-components/#slots).

### Gatsby Styling to Astro

[Section titled “Gatsby Styling to Astro”](#gatsby-styling-to-astro)

You may need to replace any [CSS-in-JS libraries](https://github.com/withastro/astro/issues/4432) (e.g. styled-components) with other available CSS options in Astro.

If necessary, convert any inline style objects (`style={{ fontWeight: "bold" }}`) to inline HTML style attributes (`style="font-weight:bold;"`). Or, use an [Astro<style>tag](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/styling/#styling-in-astro) for scoped CSS styles.

 src/components/Card.astro

```
<div style={{backgroundColor: `#f4f4f4`, padding: `1em`}}>{message}</div><div style="background-color: #f4f4f4; padding: 1em;">{message}</div>
```

Tailwind is supported after installing the [Tailwind Vite plugin](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/styling/#tailwind). No changes to your existing Tailwind code are required!

Global styling is achieved in Gatsby using CSS imports in `gatsby-browser.js`. In Astro, you will import `.css` files directly into a main layout component to achieve global styles.

See more about [Styling in Astro](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/styling/).

### Gatsby Image Plugin to Astro

[Section titled “Gatsby Image Plugin to Astro”](#gatsby-image-plugin-to-astro)

Convert Gatsby’s `<StaticImage />` and `<GatsbyImage />` components to [Astro’s own image integration components](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/images/), or to a [standard HTML<img>/ JSX<img />](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/images/#images-in-ui-framework-components) tag as appropriate in your React components.

 src/pages/index.astro

```
---import { Image } from 'astro:assets';import rocket from '../assets/rocket.png';---<Image src={rocket} alt="A rocketship in space." /><img src={rocket.src} alt="A rocketship in space.">
```

Astro’s `<Image />` component works in `.astro` and `.mdx` files only. See a [full list of its component attributes](https://docs.astro.build/en/reference/modules/astro-assets/#image-) and note that several will differ from Gatsby’s attributes.

To continue using [images in Markdown (.md) files](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/images/#images-in-markdown-files) using standard Markdown syntax (`![]()`), you may need to update the link. Using the HTML `<img>` tag directly is not supported in `.md` files for local images, and must be converted to Markdown syntax.

 src/pages/post-1.md

```
# My Markdown Page
![A starry night sky.](../assets/stars.png)
```

In React (`.jsx`) components, use standard JSX image syntax (`<img />`). Astro will not optimize these images, but you can install and use NPM packages for more flexibility.

You can learn more about [using images in Astro](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/images/) in the Images Guide.

### Gatsby GraphQL to Astro

[Section titled “Gatsby GraphQL to Astro”](#gatsby-graphql-to-astro)

Remove all references to GraphQL queries, and instead use [import.meta.glob()](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/imports/#importmetaglob) to access data from your local files.

Or, if using content collections, query your Markdown and MDX files using [getEntry()andgetCollection()](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/#generating-routes-from-content).

These data requests are made in the frontmatter of the Astro component using the data.

 src/pages/index.astro

```
---import { graphql } from "gatsby"import { getCollection } from 'astro:content';
// Get all `src/content/blog/` entriesconst allBlogPosts = await getCollection('blog');
// Get all `src/pages/posts/` entriesconst allPosts = Object.values(import.meta.glob('../pages/post/*.md', { eager: true }));---
export const pageQuery = graphql`  {    allMarkdownRemark(sort: { frontmatter: { date: DESC } }) {      nodes {        excerpt        fields {          slug        }        frontmatter {          date(formatString: "MMMM DD, YYYY")          title          description        }      }    }  }`
```

## Guided example: Gatsby layout to Astro

[Section titled “Guided example: Gatsby layout to Astro”](#guided-example-gatsby-layout-to-astro)

This example converts the main project layout (`layout.js`) from Gatsby’s blog starter to `src/layouts/Layout.astro`.

This page layout shows one header when visiting the home page, and a different header with a link back to Home for all other pages.

1. Identify the `return()` JSX.
   layout.js
  ```
  import * as React from "react"import { Link } from "gatsby"const Layout = ({ location, title, children }) => {  const rootPath = `${__PATH_PREFIX__}/`  const isRootPath = location.pathname === rootPath  let header  if (isRootPath) {    header = (      <h1 className="main-heading">        <Link to="/">{title}</Link>      </h1>    )  } else {    header = (      <Link className="header-link-home" to="/">        Home      </Link>    )  }  return (    <div className="global-wrapper" data-is-root-path={isRootPath}>      <header className="global-header">{header}</header>      <main>{children}</main>      <footer>        © {new Date().getFullYear()}, Built with        {` `}        <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.com">Gatsby</a>      </footer>    </div>  )}export default Layout
  ```
2. Create `Layout.astro` and add this `return` value, [converted to Astro syntax](#reference-convert-to-astro-syntax).
  Note that:
  - `{new Date().getFullYear()}` just works 🎉
  - `{children}` becomes `<slot />` 🦥
  - `className` becomes `class` 📛
  - `Gatsby` becomes `Astro` 🚀
   src/layouts/Layout.astro
  ```
  ------<div class="global-wrapper" data-is-root-path={isRootPath}>  <header class="global-header">{header}</header>  <main><slot /></main>  <footer>    © {new Date().getFullYear()}, Built with    {` `}    <a href="https://www.astro.build">Astro</a>  </footer></div>
  ```
3. Add a page shell so that your layout provides each page with the necessary parts of an HTML document:
   src/layouts/Layout.astro
  ```
  ------<html>  <head>    <meta charset="utf-8" />    <link rel="icon" type="image/svg+xml" href="/favicon.svg" />    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width" />    <title>Astro</title>  </head>  <body>    <div class="global-wrapper" data-is-root-path={isRootPath}>      <header class="global-header">{header}</header>      <main>        <slot />      </main>      <footer>        &#169; {new Date().getFullYear()}, Built with        {` `}        <a href="https://www.astro.build">Astro</a>      </footer>    </div>  </body></html>
  ```
4. Add any needed imports, props, and JavaScript
  To conditionally render a header based on the page route and title in Astro:
  - Provide the props via `Astro.props`. (Remember: your Astro templating accesses props from its frontmatter, not passed into a function.)
  - Use a ternary operator to show one heading if this is the home page, and a different heading otherwise.
  - Remove variables for `{header}` and `{isRootPath}` as they are no longer needed.
  - Replace Gatsby’s `<Link/>` tags with `<a>` anchor tags.
  - Use `class` instead of `className`.
  - Import a local stylesheet from your project for the class names to take effect.
   src/layouts/Layout.astro
  ```
  ---import '../styles/style.css';const { title, pathname } = Astro.props---<html>  <head>    <meta charset="utf-8" />    <link rel="icon" type="image/svg+xml" href="/favicon.svg" />    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width" />    <title>Astro</title>  </head>  <body>    <div class="global-wrapper">      <header class="global-header">        { pathname === "/"        ?          <h1 class="main-heading">          <a href="/">{title}</a>          </h1>        :          <h1 class="main-heading">          <a class="header-link-home" href="/">Home</a>          </h1>        }      </header>      <main>        <slot />      </main>      <footer>        &#169; {new Date().getFullYear()}, Built with        {` `}        <a href="https://www.astro.build">Astro</a>      </footer>    </div>  </body></html>
  ```
5. Update `index.astro` to use this new layout and pass it the necessary `title` and `pathname` props:
   src/pages/index.astro
  ```
  ---import Layout from '../layouts/Layout.astro';const pagePathname = Astro.url.pathname---<Layout title="Home Page" pathname={pagePathname}>    <p>Astro</p></Layout>
  ```
6. To test the conditional header, create a second page, `about.astro` using the same pattern:
   src/pages/about.astro
  ```
  ---import Layout from '../layouts/Layout.astro';const pagePathname = Astro.url.pathname---<Layout title="About" pathname={pagePathname}>    <p>About</p></Layout>
  ```
  You should see a link to “Home” only when visiting the About page.

# Migrating from GitBook

> Tips for migrating an existing GitBook project to Astro

# Migrating from GitBook

[GitBook](https://gitbook.com) is a web-based platform for creating and publishing documentation and books in a collaborative manner, with version control integration and customizable features.

## Key Similarities between GitBook and Astro

[Section titled “Key Similarities between GitBook and Astro”](#key-similarities-between-gitbook-and-astro)

GitBook and Astro share some similarities that will help you migrate your project:

- Both Astro and GitBook support [Markdown](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/markdown-content/). You can migrate all your existing documentation utilizing GitBook’s Git Sync feature.
- Both Astro and GitBook use some form of [file-based routing](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/routing/). Using Astro’s file structure for your existing content and when adding new pages should feel familiar.

## Key Differences between GitBook and Astro

[Section titled “Key Differences between GitBook and Astro”](#key-differences-between-gitbook-and-astro)

When you migrate your GitBook docs to Astro, you will notice some important differences:

- A GitBook site is edited using an online dashboard. In Astro, you will use a [code editor](https://docs.astro.build/en/editor-setup/) and development environment to maintain your site. You can develop locally on your machine, or choose a cloud editor/development environment like IDX, StackBlitz, CodeSandbox, or Gitpod.
- GitBook stores your content in a database. In Astro, you will have individual files (typically Markdown or MDX) in your [project directory](https://docs.astro.build/en/basics/project-structure/) for each page’s content. Or, you can choose to use a [CMS for your content](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/cms/) and use Astro to fetch and present the data.
- GitBook uses a custom syntax on top of Markdown for content. Astro supports Markdoc via the optional [Markdoc integration](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/markdoc/), which features a similar syntax to the one you would use in GitBook.

## Switch from GitBook to Astro

[Section titled “Switch from GitBook to Astro”](#switch-from-gitbook-to-astro)

To convert a GitBook documentation site to Astro, start with our official [Starlight docs theme starter template](https://starlight.astro.build), or explore more community docs themes in our [theme showcase](https://astro.build/themes?search=&categories%5B%5D=docs).

You can pass a `--template` argument to the `create astro` command to start a new Astro project with one of our official starters. Or, you can [start a new project from any existing Astro repository on GitHub](https://docs.astro.build/en/install-and-setup/#install-from-the-cli-wizard).

- [npm](#tab-panel-3113)
- [pnpm](#tab-panel-3114)
- [Yarn](#tab-panel-3115)

   Terminal window

```
npm create astro@latest -- --template starlight
```

   Terminal window

```
pnpm create astro@latest --template starlight
```

   Terminal window

```
yarn create astro --template starlight
```

Once you have a new Astro project, you can sync your existing GitBook content to your new Astro project. GitBook has a [Git Sync feature](https://docs.gitbook.com/product-tour/git-sync) that will automatically sync your GitBook content to a GitHub/GitLab repository.

To sync directly to the docs template’s content collection, specify `src/content/docs/en` or `src/content/docs` as the project directory.

After syncing the content, you will now have a copy of your GitBook content in your Astro repository. Disable git sync to prevent future syncing with GitBook.

Note that although you now have your content migrated to your Astro project, it will not be immediately usable. To use this content in your Astro site, you will need to spend some time manually changing GitBook’s syntax into a format compatible with Astro. In particular:

- Astro’s [Markdoc integration](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/markdoc/) requires that the file extension be `.mdoc`. This is to avoid conflicts with other Markdown extensions like `.mdx` and `.md`.
- GitBook syntax differs from Markdoc where the `/` prefix denoting a closing tag is replaced with `end` for GitBook files. You will need to update this notation throughout your files.
- Some features of GitBook rely on custom components. These components will not exist in Astro and must be created and added to your project through [Markdoc’s configtagsattribute](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/markdoc/#use-astro-components-as-markdoc-tags) or removed from your files.

# Migrating from Gridsome

> Tips for migrating an existing Gridsome project to Astro

# Migrating from Gridsome

[Gridsome](https://gridsome.org) is an open-source static site generator built on Vue and GraphQL.

## Key Similarities between Gridsome and Astro

[Section titled “Key Similarities between Gridsome and Astro”](#key-similarities-between-gridsome-and-astro)

Gridsome and Astro share some similarities that will help you migrate your project:

- Both Gridsome and Astro are modern JavaScript static-site generators with similar [project file structures](https://docs.astro.build/en/basics/project-structure/#directories-and-files).
- Both Gridsome and Astro use a `src/` folder for your project files and a [specialsrc/pages/folder for file-based routing](https://docs.astro.build/en/basics/astro-pages/). Creating and managing pages for your site should feel familiar.
- Astro has [an official integration for using Vue components](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/vue/) and supports [installing NPM packages](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/imports/#npm-packages), including several for Vue. You will be able to write Vue UI components, and may be able to keep some or all of your existing Gridsome Vue components and dependencies.
- Astro and Gridsome both allow you to use a [headless CMS, APIs or Markdown files for data](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/data-fetching/). You can continue to use your preferred content authoring system, and will be able to keep your existing content.

## Key Differences between Gridsome and Astro

[Section titled “Key Differences between Gridsome and Astro”](#key-differences-between-gridsome-and-astro)

When you rebuild your Gridsome site in Astro, you will notice some important differences:

- Gridsome is a Vue-based single-page application (SPA). Astro sites are multi-page apps built using [.astrocomponents](https://docs.astro.build/en/basics/astro-components/), but can also support [React, Preact, Vue.js, Svelte, SolidJS, AlpineJS](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/framework-components/) and raw HTML templating.
- As an SPA, Gridsome uses `vue-router` for SPA routing, and `vue-meta` for managing `<head>`. In Astro, you will create separate HTML pages and control your page `<head>` directly, or in a [layout component](https://docs.astro.build/en/basics/layouts/).
- [Local file data](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/imports/): Gridsome uses GraphQL to retrieve data from your project files. Astro uses ESM imports and [import.meta.glob()](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/imports/#importmetaglob) to import data from local project files. Remote resources can be loaded using the standard `fetch()` API. GraphQL may be optionally added to your project, but is not included by default.

## Switch from Gridsome to Astro

[Section titled “Switch from Gridsome to Astro”](#switch-from-gridsome-to-astro)

To convert a Gridsome blog to Astro, start with our blog theme starter template, or explore more community blog themes in our [theme showcase](https://astro.build/themes/).

You can pass a `--template` argument to the `create astro` command to start a new Astro project with one of our official starters. Or, you can [start a new project from any existing Astro repository on GitHub](https://docs.astro.build/en/install-and-setup/#install-from-the-cli-wizard).

- [npm](#tab-panel-3119)
- [pnpm](#tab-panel-3120)
- [Yarn](#tab-panel-3121)

   Terminal window

```
npm create astro@latest -- --template blog
```

   Terminal window

```
pnpm create astro@latest --template blog
```

   Terminal window

```
yarn create astro --template blog
```

Bring your existing Markdown (or MDX, with our optional integration) files as content to [create Markdown or MDX pages](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/markdown-content/).

Since Gridsome’s project structure is similar to Astro’s, you may be able to copy several existing files from your project into the same location in your new Astro project. However, the two project structures are not identical. You may want to examine [Astro’s project structure](https://docs.astro.build/en/basics/project-structure/) to see what the differences are.

Since Astro queries and imports your local files differently than Gridsome, you may want to read about how to load files using [import.meta.glob()](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/imports/#importmetaglob) to understand how to work with your local files.

To convert other types of sites, such as a portfolio or documentation site, see more official starter templates on [astro.new](https://astro.new). You’ll find a link to each project’s GitHub repository, as well as one-click links to open a working project in IDX, StackBlitz, CodeSandbox and Gitpod online development environments.

# Migrating from Hugo

> Tips for migrating an existing Hugo project to Astro

# Migrating from Hugo

[Hugo](https://gohugo.io) is an open-source static site generator built on Go.

## Key Similarities between Hugo and Astro

[Section titled “Key Similarities between Hugo and Astro”](#key-similarities-between-hugo-and-astro)

Hugo and Astro share some similarities that will help you migrate your project:

- Hugo and Astro are both modern static-site generators, ideally suited to [content-driven websites](https://docs.astro.build/en/concepts/why-astro/#content-driven) like blogs.
- Hugo and Astro both allow you to [author your content in Markdown](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/markdown-content/). However, Hugo includes several special frontmatter properties and allows you to write frontmatter in YAML, TOML or JSON. Even though many of your existing Hugo frontmatter properties will not be “special” in Astro, you can continue to use your existing Markdown files and YAML (or TOML) frontmatter values.
- Hugo and Astro both allow you to enhance your site with a variety of [integrations and external packages](https://astro.build/integrations/).

## Key Differences between Hugo and Astro

[Section titled “Key Differences between Hugo and Astro”](#key-differences-between-hugo-and-astro)

When you rebuild your Hugo site in Astro, you will notice some important differences:

- Hugo uses Go Templating for page templating. [Astro syntax](https://docs.astro.build/en/basics/astro-components/) is a JSX-like superset of HTML.
- Astro does not use shortcodes for dynamic content in standard Markdown files, but [Astro’s MDX integration](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/mdx/) does allow you to use JSX and import components in MDX files.
- While Hugo can use “partials” for reusable layout elements, [Astro is entirely component-based](https://docs.astro.build/en/basics/astro-components/). Any `.astro` file can be a component, a layout or an entire page, and can import and render any other Astro components. Astro components can also include [other UI framework components (e.g. React, Svelte, Vue, Solid)](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/framework-components/) as well as content or metadata from [other files in your project](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/imports/), such as Markdown or MDX.

## Switch from Hugo to Astro

[Section titled “Switch from Hugo to Astro”](#switch-from-hugo-to-astro)

To convert a Hugo blog to Astro, start with our blog theme starter template, or explore more community blog themes in our [theme showcase](https://astro.build/themes/).

You can pass a `--template` argument to the `create astro` command to start a new Astro project with one of our official starters. Or, you can [start a new project from any existing Astro repository on GitHub](https://docs.astro.build/en/install-and-setup/#install-from-the-cli-wizard).

- [npm](#tab-panel-3116)
- [pnpm](#tab-panel-3117)
- [Yarn](#tab-panel-3118)

   Terminal window

```
npm create astro@latest -- --template blog
```

   Terminal window

```
pnpm create astro@latest --template blog
```

   Terminal window

```
yarn create astro --template blog
```

Bring your existing Markdown (or MDX, with our optional integration) files as content to [create Markdown or MDX pages](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/markdown-content/). Astro allows YAML or TOML frontmatter in these files, so if you are using JSON frontmatter, you will need to convert it.

To continue to use dynamic content such as variables, expressions or UI components within your Markdown content, add Astro’s optional MDX integration and convert your existing Markdown files to [MDX pages](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/markdown-content/). MDX supports YAML and TOML frontmatter, so you can keep your existing frontmatter properties. But, you must replace any shortcode syntax with [MDX’s own syntax](https://mdxjs.com/docs/what-is-mdx/#mdx-syntax), which allows JSX expressions and/or component imports.

To convert other types of sites, such as a portfolio or documentation site, see more official starter templates on [astro.new](https://astro.new). You’ll find a link to each project’s GitHub repository, as well as one-click links to open a working project in IDX, StackBlitz, CodeSandbox and Gitpod online development environments.
