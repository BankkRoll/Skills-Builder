# Experimental Chrome DevTools workspace

# Experimental Chrome DevTools workspace

**Type:** `boolean`
 **Default:** `false`

 **Added in:** `astro@5.13.0`

Enables experimental [Chrome DevTools workspace integration](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/workspaces) for the Astro dev server.

This feature allows you to edit files directly in Chrome DevTools and have those changes reflected in your local file system via a connected workspace folder. This is useful for applying edits such as adjusting CSS values without leaving your browser tab.

With this feature enabled, running `astro dev` will automatically configure a Chrome DevTools workspace for your project. Your project will then appear as an available [workspace source that you can connect](#connecting-your-project). Then, changes that you make in the “Sources” panel are automatically saved to your project source code.

To enable this feature, add the experimental flag `chromeDevtoolsWorkspace` to your Astro config:

 astro.config.mjs

```
import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';
export default defineConfig({  experimental: {    chromeDevtoolsWorkspace: true,  },});
```

## Connecting your project

[Section titled “Connecting your project”](#connecting-your-project)

Astro will create the necessary configuration file to support Chrome DevTools workspaces. However, your project must also be [connected as a source](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/workspaces#manual-connection) to enable file saving.

1. [Start the Astro dev server](https://docs.astro.build/en/develop-and-build/#start-the-astro-dev-server) with the appropriate CLI command for your package manager.
2. Navigate to your site preview (e.g. `http://localhost:4321/`) in Chrome and open DevTools.
3. Under the **Sources** > **Workspaces** tab, you will find your Astro project folder. Click **Connect** to add your directory as a workspace.

See the [Chrome DevTools workspace documentation](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/workspaces#connect) for more information.

# Experimental client prerendering

# Experimental client prerendering

**Type:** `boolean`
 **Default:** `false`

 **Added in:** `astro@4.2.0`

Enables pre-rendering your prefetched pages on the client in supported browsers.

This feature uses the experimental [Speculation Rules Web API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Speculation_Rules_API) and enhances the default `prefetch` behavior globally to prerender links on the client.
You may wish to review the [possible risks when prerendering on the client](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Speculation_Rules_API#unsafe_prefetching) before enabling this feature.

Enable client side prerendering in your `astro.config.mjs` along with any desired `prefetch` configuration options:

 astro.config.mjs

```
{  prefetch: {    prefetchAll: true,    defaultStrategy: 'viewport',  },  experimental: {    clientPrerender: true,  },}
```

Continue to use the `data-astro-prefetch` attribute on any `<a />` link on your site to opt in to prefetching.
Instead of appending a `<link>` tag to the head of the document or fetching the page with JavaScript, a `<script>` tag will be appended with the corresponding speculation rules.

Client side prerendering requires browser support. If the Speculation Rules API is not supported, `prefetch` will fallback to the supported strategy.

See the [Prefetch Guide](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/prefetch/) for more `prefetch` options and usage.

# Experimental Intellisense for content collections

# Experimental Intellisense for content collections

**Type:** `boolean`
 **Default:** `false`

 **Added in:** `astro@4.14.0`

Enables Intellisense features (e.g. code completion, quick hints) for your content collection entries in compatible editors.

When enabled, this feature will generate and add JSON schemas to the `.astro` directory in your project. These files can be used by the Astro language server to provide Intellisense inside content files (`.md`, `.mdx`, `.mdoc`).

```
{  experimental: {    contentIntellisense: true,  },}
```

To use this feature with the Astro VS Code extension, you must also enable the `astro.content-intellisense` option in your VS Code settings. For editors using the Astro language server directly, pass the `contentIntellisense: true` initialization parameter to enable this feature.

# Experimental Content Security Policy (CSP)

# Experimental Content Security Policy (CSP)

**Type:** `boolean | object`
 **Default:** `false`

 **Added in:** `astro@5.9.0`

Enables support for [Content Security Policy (CSP)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Guides/CSP) to help minimize certain types of security threats by controlling which resources a document is allowed to load. This provides additional protection against [cross-site scripting (XSS)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Cross-site_scripting) attacks.

Enabling this feature adds additional security to **Astro’s handling of processed and bundled scripts and styles** by default, and allows you to further configure these, and additional, content types.

This experimental CSP feature has some limitations. Inline scripts are not supported out of the box, but you can [provide your own hashes](#hashes) for external and inline scripts. [Astro’s view transitions](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/view-transitions/) using the `<ClientRouter />` are not supported, but you can [consider migrating to the browser native View Transition API](https://events-3bg.pages.dev/jotter/astro-view-transitions/) instead if you are not using Astro’s enhancements to the native View Transitions and Navigation APIs.

To enable this feature, add the experimental flag in your Astro config:

 astro.config.mjs

```
import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';
export default defineConfig({  experimental: {    csp: true  }});
```

When enabled, Astro will add a `<meta>` element inside the `<head>` element of each page.

This element will have the `http-equiv="content-security-policy"` attribute, and the `content` attribute will provide values for the `script-src` and `style-src` [directives](#directives) based on the script and styles used in the page.

```
<head>  <meta    http-equiv="content-security-policy"    content="      script-src 'self' 'sha256-somehash';      style-src 'self' 'sha256-somehash';    "  ></head>
```

## Configuration

[Section titled “Configuration”](#configuration)

You can further customize the `<meta>` element by enabling this feature with a configuration object that includes additional options.

### algorithm

[Section titled “algorithm”](#algorithm)

**Type:** `'SHA-256' | 'SHA-512' | 'SHA-384'`
 **Default:** `'SHA-256'`

 **Added in:** `astro@5.9.0`

The [hash function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Hash_function) to use when generating the hashes of the styles and scripts emitted by Astro.

 astro.config.mjs

```
import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';
export default defineConfig({  experimental: {    csp: {      algorithm: 'SHA-512'    }  }});
```

### directives

[Section titled “directives”](#directives)

**Type:** `CspDirective[]`
 **Default:** `[]`

 **Added in:** `astro@5.9.0`

A list of [CSP directives](https://content-security-policy.com/#directive) that defines valid sources for specific content types.

While Astro needs to control the `script-src` and `style-src` directives, it is possible to control other CSP directives using the `csp.directives` field. These directives are added to all pages. It accepts a list of type-safe directives:

 astro.config.mjs

```
import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';
export default defineConfig({  experimental: {    csp: {      directives: [        "default-src 'self'",        "img-src 'self' https://images.cdn.example.com"      ]    }  }});
```

After the build, the `<meta>` element will add your directives into the `content` value alongside Astro’s default directives:

```
<meta  http-equiv="content-security-policy"  content="    default-src 'self';    img-src 'self' 'https://images.cdn.example.com';    script-src 'self' 'sha256-somehash';    style-src 'self' 'sha256-somehash';  ">
```

### styleDirectiveandscriptDirective

[Section titled “styleDirective and scriptDirective”](#styledirective-and-scriptdirective)

**Type:** `object`
 **Default:** `{}`

 **Added in:** `astro@5.9.0`

Configuration objects that allow you to override the default sources for the `style-src` and `script-src` directives with the [resources](#resources) property, or to provide additional [hashes](#hashes) to be rendered.

These properties are added to all pages and **completely override Astro’s default resources**, not add to them. Therefore, you must explicitly specify any default values that you want to be included.

#### resources

[Section titled “resources”](#resources)

**Type:** `string[]`
 **Default:** `[]`

 **Added in:** `astro@5.9.0`

A list of valid sources for the `script-src` and `style-src` directives, including [values for subclasses](#adding-values-for-subclasses).

The `script-src` and `style-src` directives are handled by Astro by default, and use the `'self'` resource. This means that scripts and styles can only be downloaded by the current host (usually the current website).

To override the default source, you can provide a list of resources instead. This will not include `'self'` by default, and must be included in this list if you wish to keep it. These resources are added to all pages.

 astro.config.mjs

```
import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';
export default defineConfig({  experimental: {    csp: {      styleDirective: {        resources: [          "'self'",          "https://styles.cdn.example.com"        ]      },      scriptDirective: {        resources: [          "https://cdn.example.com"        ]      }    }  }});
```

After the build, the `<meta>` element will instead apply your sources to the `style-src` and `script-src` directives:

```
<head>  <meta    http-equiv="content-security-policy"    content="      script-src https://cdn.example.com 'sha256-somehash';      style-src 'self' https://styles.cdn.example.com 'sha256-somehash';    "  ></head>
```

##### Adding values for subclasses

[Section titled “Adding values for subclasses”](#adding-values-for-subclasses)

You can also use this field to add valid values that belong to [script-src-attr](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Content-Security-Policy/script-src-attr), [script-src-elem](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Content-Security-Policy/script-src-elem), [style-src-attr](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Content-Security-Policy/style-src-attr) and [style-src-elem](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Content-Security-Policy/style-src-elem), such as `unsafe-hashes` and `unsafe-inline`.

For example, if you have an external library that adds scripts or inline styles to some HTML elements of the page, you can add `unsafe-inline` to tell the browser that they are safe to render.

 astro.config.mjs

```
import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';
export default defineConfig({  experimental: {    csp: {      styleDirective: {        resources: [          "'unsafe-inline'"        ]      },      scriptDirective: {        resources: [          "'unsafe-inline'"        ]      }    }  }});
```

After the build, `style-src` and `script-src` directives will contain the `'unsafe-line'` resource:

```
<head>  <meta    http-equiv="content-security-policy"    content="      script-src 'unsafe-line';      style-src 'unsafe-line';    "  ></head>
```

##### Multiple resources

[Section titled “Multiple resources”](#multiple-resources)

When resources are inserted multiple times or from multiple sources (e.g. defined in your `csp` config and added using [the CSP runtime API](#runtime-apis)), Astro will remove any duplicates, and merge the new ones.

In the following example, the directives `img-src https://global.cdn.example.org` and `default-src https://global.cdn.example.org` are set in `csp` configuration and will be applied to all pages.

 astro.config.mjs

```
export default defineConfig({  experimental: {    csp: {      directives: [        "img-src https://global.cdn.example.org",        "default-src https://global.cdn.example.org"      ]    }  }})
```

Additionally, on an individual page, the resources `img-src https://vendor.cdn.example.org/` and `default-src https://global.cdn.example.org/ https://vendor.cdn.example.org/` are added using the [Astro.csp.insertDirective](#cspinsertdirective).

 src/pages/index.astro

```
---Astro.csp.insertDirective("img-src https://vendor.cdn.example.org")Astro.csp.insertDirective("default-src https://global.cdn.example.org https://vendor.cdn.example.org")---
```

During the build, the resources of the directives `img-src` and `default-src` for the `index.html` page are merged and deduplicated to create the appropriate headers.

```
<head>  <meta    http-equiv="content-security-policy"    content="        img-src https://global.cdn.example.org https://vendor.cdn.example.org;        default-src https://global.cdn.example.org https://vendor.cdn.example.org;    "  ></head>
```

#### hashes

[Section titled “hashes”](#hashes)

**Type:** `CspHash[]`
 **Default:** `[]`

 **Added in:** `astro@5.9.0`

A list of additional hashes to be rendered.

If you have external scripts or styles that aren’t generated by Astro, or inline scripts, this configuration option allows you to provide additional hashes to be rendered.

You must provide hashes that start with `sha384-`, `sha512-` or `sha256-`. Other values will cause a validation error. These hashes are added to all pages.

 astro.config.mjs

```
import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';
export default defineConfig({  experimental: {    csp: {      styleDirective: {        hashes: [          "sha384-styleHash",          "sha512-styleHash",          "sha256-styleHash"        ]      },      scriptDirective: {        hashes: [          "sha384-scriptHash",          "sha512-scriptHash",          "sha256-scriptHash"        ]      }    }  }});
```

After the build, the `<meta>` element will include your additional hashes in the `script-src` and `style-src` directives:

```
<meta  http-equiv="content-security-policy"  content="    script-src 'self' 'sha384-scriptHash' 'sha512-scriptHash' 'sha256-scriptHash' 'sha256-generatedByAstro';    style-src 'self' 'sha384-styleHash' 'sha512-styleHash' 'sha256-styleHash' 'sha256-generatedByAstro';  ">
```

#### strictDynamic

[Section titled “strictDynamic”](#strictdynamic)

**Type:** `boolean`
 **Default:** `false`

 **Added in:** `astro@5.9.0`

Enables [thestrict-dynamickeyword](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Guides/CSP#the_strict-dynamic_keyword) to support the dynamic injection of scripts.

 astro.config.mjs

```
import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';
export default defineConfig({  experimental: {    csp: {      scriptDirective: {        strictDynamic: true      }    }  }});
```

## Runtime APIs

[Section titled “Runtime APIs”](#runtime-apis)

You can customize the `<meta>` element per page via runtime APIs available from the `Astro` global inside `.astro` components, or the `APIContext` type in endpoints and middleware.

### csp.insertDirective

[Section titled “csp.insertDirective”](#cspinsertdirective)

**Type:** `(directive: CspDirective) => void`

 **Added in:** `astro@5.9.0`

Adds a single directive to the current page. You can call this method multiple times to add additional directives.

```
---Astro.csp.insertDirective("default-src 'self'");Astro.csp.insertDirective("img-src 'self' https://images.cdn.example.com");---
```

After the build, the `<meta>` element for this individual page will incorporate your additional directives alongside the existing `script-src` and `style-src` directives:

```
<meta  http-equiv="content-security-policy"  content="    default-src 'self';    img-src 'self' https://images.cdn.example.com;    script-src 'self' 'sha256-somehash';    style-src 'self' 'sha256-somehash';  ">
```

### csp.insertStyleResource

[Section titled “csp.insertStyleResource”](#cspinsertstyleresource)

**Type:** `(resource: string) => void`

 **Added in:** `astro@5.9.0`

Inserts a new resource to be used for the `style-src` directive.

```
---Astro.csp.insertStyleResource("https://styles.cdn.example.com");---
```

After the build, the `<meta>` element for this individual page will add your source to the default `style-src` directive:

```
<meta  http-equiv="content-security-policy"  content="    script-src 'self' 'sha256-somehash';    style-src https://styles.cdn.example.com 'sha256-somehash';  ">
```

### csp.insertStyleHash

[Section titled “csp.insertStyleHash”](#cspinsertstylehash)

**Type:** `(hash: CspHash) => void`

 **Added in:** `astro@5.9.0`

Adds a new hash to the `style-src` directive.

```
---Astro.csp.insertStyleHash("sha512-styleHash");---
```

After the build, the `<meta>` element for this individual page will add your hash to the default `style-src` directive:

```
<meta  http-equiv="content-security-policy"  content="    script-src 'self' 'sha256-somehash';    style-src 'self' 'sha256-somehash' 'sha512-styleHash';  ">
```

### csp.insertScriptResource

[Section titled “csp.insertScriptResource”](#cspinsertscriptresource)

# Experimental prerender conflict error

# Experimental prerender conflict error

**Type:** `boolean`
 **Default:** `false`

 **Added in:** `astro@5.14.0`

Turns prerender conflict warnings into errors during the build process.

Astro currently warns you during the build about any conflicts between multiple dynamic routes that can result in the same output path. For example `/blog/[slug]` and `/blog/[...all]` both could try to prerender the `/blog/post-1` path. In such cases, Astro renders only the [highest priority route](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/routing/#route-priority-order) for the conflicting path. This allows your site to build successfully, although you may discover that some pages are rendered by unexpected routes.

With this experimental flag set, the build will instead fail immediately with an error. This will require you to resolve any routing conflicts immediately, and will ensure that Astro is building your routes as you intend.

To enable this behavior, add the `experimental.failOnPrerenderConflict` feature flag to your Astro config:

 astro.config.mjs

```
import { defineConfig } from "astro/config"
defineConfig({  experimental: {    failOnPrerenderConflict: true,  },});
```

## Usage

[Section titled “Usage”](#usage)

After enabling this flag, you may encounter errors about conflicting prerendered routes when you attempt to build your project. If this happens, you will need to update one or more of your [dynamic routes](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/routing/#dynamic-routes) to avoid ambiguous routing.
