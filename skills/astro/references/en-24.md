  v6.6.4 [GitHub](https://github.com/withastro/astro/tree/main/packages/integrations/netlify/) [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@astrojs/netlify) [Changelog](https://github.com/withastro/astro/tree/main/packages/integrations/netlify/CHANGELOG.md)

This adapter allows Astro to deploy your [on-demand rendered routes and features](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/on-demand-rendering/) to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), including [server islands](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/server-islands/), [actions](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/actions/), and [sessions](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/sessions/).

If you’re using Astro as a static site builder, you only need this adapter if you are using additional Netlify services that require a server (e.g. [Netlify Image CDN](#netlify-image-cdn-support)). Otherwise, you do not need an adapter to deploy your static site.

Learn how to deploy your Astro site in our [Netlify deployment guide](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/deploy/netlify/).

## Why Astro Netlify

[Section titled “Why Astro Netlify”](#why-astro-netlify)

[Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) is a deployment platform that allows you to host your site by connecting directly to your GitHub repository. This adapter enhances the Astro build process to prepare your project for deployment through Netlify.

## Installation

[Section titled “Installation”](#installation)

Astro includes an `astro add` command to automate the setup of official integrations. If you prefer, you can [install integrations manually](#manual-install) instead.

Add the Netlify adapter to enable on-demand rendering in your Astro project with the `astro add` command.
This will install `@astrojs/netlify` and make the appropriate changes to your `astro.config.mjs` file in one step.

- [npm](#tab-panel-2974)
- [pnpm](#tab-panel-2975)
- [Yarn](#tab-panel-2976)

   Terminal window

```
npx astro add netlify
```

   Terminal window

```
pnpm astro add netlify
```

   Terminal window

```
yarn astro add netlify
```

Now, you can enable [on-demand rendering per page](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/on-demand-rendering/#enabling-on-demand-rendering), or set your build output configuration to `output: 'server'` to [server-render all your pages by default](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/on-demand-rendering/#server-mode).

### Manual Install

[Section titled “Manual Install”](#manual-install)

First, install the Netlify adapter to your project’s dependencies using your preferred package manager:

- [npm](#tab-panel-2977)
- [pnpm](#tab-panel-2978)
- [Yarn](#tab-panel-2979)

   Terminal window

```
npm install @astrojs/netlify
```

   Terminal window

```
pnpm add @astrojs/netlify
```

   Terminal window

```
yarn add @astrojs/netlify
```

Then, add the adapter to your `astro.config.*` file:

 astro.config.mjs

```
import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config'; import netlify from '@astrojs/netlify';
 export default defineConfig({    // ...    adapter: netlify(), });
```

## Usage

[Section titled “Usage”](#usage)

[Read the full deployment guide here.](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/deploy/netlify/)

Follow the instructions to [build your site locally](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/deploy/#building-your-site-locally). After building, you will have a `.netlify/` folder containing both [Netlify Functions](https://docs.netlify.com/functions/overview/) in the `.netlify/functions-internal/` folder and [Netlify Edge Functions](https://docs.netlify.com/edge-functions/overview/) in the`.netlify/edge-functions/` folder.

To deploy your site, install the [Netlify CLI](https://docs.netlify.com/cli/get-started/) and run:

 Terminal window

```
netlify deploy
```

The [Netlify Blog post on Astro](https://www.netlify.com/blog/how-to-deploy-astro/) and the [Netlify Docs](https://docs.netlify.com/integrations/frameworks/astro/) provide more information on how to use this integration to deploy to Netlify.

### Running Astro middleware on Netlify Edge Functions

[Section titled “Running Astro middleware on Netlify Edge Functions”](#running-astro-middleware-on-netlify-edge-functions)

Any Astro middleware is applied to pre-rendered pages at build-time, and to on-demand-rendered pages at runtime.

To implement redirects, access control, or custom response headers for pre-rendered pages, run your middleware on Netlify Edge Functions by enabling the [edgeMiddlewareoption](https://docs.astro.build/en/reference/adapter-reference/#edgemiddleware):

 astro.config.mjs

```
import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';import netlify from '@astrojs/netlify';
export default defineConfig({  // ...  adapter: netlify({    edgeMiddleware: true,  }),});
```

When `edgeMiddleware` is enabled, an edge function will execute your middleware code for all requests including static assets, prerendered pages, and on-demand rendered pages.

For on-demand rendered pages, the `context.locals` object is serialized using JSON and sent in a header for the serverless function, which performs the rendering. As a security measure, the serverless function will refuse to serve requests with a `403 Forbidden` response unless they come from the generated edge function.

### Accessing edge context from your site

[Section titled “Accessing edge context from your site”](#accessing-edge-context-from-your-site)

Netlify Edge Functions provide a [context object](https://docs.netlify.com/edge-functions/api/#netlify-specific-context-object) that includes metadata about the request such as a user’s IP, geolocation data, and cookies.

This can be accessed through the `Astro.locals.netlify.context` object:

```
---const {  geo: { city },} = Astro.locals.netlify.context;---
<h1>Hello there, friendly visitor from {city}!</h1>
```

If you’re using TypeScript, you can [get proper typings](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/typescript/#extending-global-types) by updating `src/env.d.ts` to use `NetlifyLocals`:

 src/env.d.ts

```
type NetlifyLocals = import('@astrojs/netlify').NetlifyLocals
declare namespace App {  interface Locals extends NetlifyLocals {    // ...  }}
```

This is not available on prerendered pages.

### Netlify Image CDN support

[Section titled “Netlify Image CDN support”](#netlify-image-cdn-support)

This adapter by default uses the [Netlify Image CDN](https://docs.netlify.com/image-cdn/overview/) to transform images on-the-fly without impacting build times.
It’s implemented using an [Astro Image Service](https://docs.astro.build/en/reference/image-service-reference/) under the hood.

To opt out of Netlify’s Image CDN remote image optimization, use the `imageCDN` option:

 astro.config.mjs

```
import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';import netlify from '@astrojs/netlify';
export default defineConfig({  // ...  adapter: netlify({    imageCDN: false,  }),});
```

If you are using images hosted on another domain, you must authorize the domain or URL patterns using the [image.domains](https://docs.astro.build/en/reference/configuration-reference/#imagedomains) or [image.remotePatterns](https://docs.astro.build/en/reference/configuration-reference/#imageremotepatterns) configuration options:

 astro.config.mjs

```
import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';import netlify from '@astrojs/netlify';
export default defineConfig({    // ...    adapter: netlify(),    image: {      domains: ['example.com'],    },});
```

For more information, see [the guide to authorizing remote images](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/images/#authorizing-remote-images). This is not required for images hosted on the same domain as your site.

### Static sites with the Netlify Adapter

[Section titled “Static sites with the Netlify Adapter”](#static-sites-with-the-netlify-adapter)

For static sites (`output: 'static'`) hosted on Netlify, you usually don’t need an adapter. However, some deployment features are only available through an adapter.

Static sites will need to install this adapter to use and configure Netlify’s [image service](#netlify-image-cdn-support).

If you use `redirects` configuration in your Astro config, the Netlify adapter can be used to translate this to the proper `_redirects` format.

 astro.config.mjs

```
import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';import netlify from '@astrojs/netlify';
export default defineConfig({  // ...  adapter: netlify(),  redirects: {    '/blog/old-post': '/blog/new-post',  },});
```

Once you run `astro build` there will be a `dist/_redirects` file. Netlify will use that to properly route pages in production.

### Sessions

[Section titled “Sessions”](#sessions)

The Astro [Sessions API](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/sessions/) allows you to easily store user data between requests. This can be used for things like user data and preferences, shopping carts, and authentication credentials. Unlike cookie storage, there are no size limits on the data, and it can be restored on different devices.

Astro automatically configures [Netlify Blobs](https://docs.netlify.com/blobs/overview/) for session storage when using the Netlify adapter. If you would prefer to use a different session storage driver, you can specify it in your Astro config. See [thesessionconfiguration reference](https://docs.astro.build/en/reference/configuration-reference/#sessiondriver) for more details.

### Caching Pages

[Section titled “Caching Pages”](#caching-pages)

On-demand rendered pages without any dynamic content can be cached to improve performance and lower resource usage.
Enabling the `cacheOnDemandPages` option in the adapter will cache all server-rendered pages for up to one year:

 astro.config.mjs

```
export default defineConfig({  // ...  adapter: netlify({    cacheOnDemandPages: true,  }),});
```

This can be changed on a per-page basis by adding caching headers to your response:

 pages/index.astro

```
---import Layout from '../components/Layout.astro';
Astro.response.headers.set('CDN-Cache-Control', 'public, max-age=45, must-revalidate');---
<Layout title="Astro on Netlify">  {new Date()}</Layout>
```

With [fine-grained cache control](https://www.netlify.com/blog/swr-and-fine-grained-cache-control/), Netlify supports
standard caching headers like `CDN-Cache-Control` or `Vary`.
Refer to the docs to learn about implementing e.g. time to live (TTL) or stale while revalidate (SWR) caching: [https://docs.netlify.com/platform/caching](https://docs.netlify.com/platform/caching)

### Skew Protection

[Section titled “Skew Protection”](#skew-protection)

**Added in:** `@astrojs/netlify@6.6.0` New

Netlify’s skew protection ensures that users accessing your site during a deployment continue to receive content from the same deploy version. The Netlify adapter automatically configures skew protection for Astro features like actions, server islands, view transitions, and prefetch requests by injecting the current deploy ID into internal requests. This prevents version mismatches between the client and server during active deployments.

While Astro automatically adds the skew protection header for its built-in features, if you are making your own fetch requests to your site, you can include the header manually using the `DEPLOY_ID` environment variable:

```
const response = await fetch('/api/endpoint', {  headers: {    'X-Netlify-Deploy-ID': import.meta.env.DEPLOY_ID,  },});
```

### Including or excluding files from Netlify Functions

[Section titled “Including or excluding files from Netlify Functions”](#including-or-excluding-files-from-netlify-functions)

When deploying an Astro site with on-demand rendering to Netlify, the generated functions automatically trace and include server dependencies. However, you may need to customize which files are included in your Netlify Functions.

#### includeFiles

[Section titled “includeFiles”](#includefiles)

**Type:** `string[]`
 **Default:** `[]`

 **Added in:** `astro@5.3.0`

The `includeFiles` property allows you to explicitly specify additional files that should be bundled with your function. This is useful for files that aren’t automatically detected as dependencies, such as:

- Data files loaded using `fs` operations
- Configuration files
- Template files

Provide an array of additional files to include with file paths relative to your project’s [root](https://docs.astro.build/en/reference/configuration-reference/#root). Absolute paths may not work as expected.

 astro.config.mjs

```
import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';import netlify from '@astrojs/netlify';
export default defineConfig({  // ...  adapter: netlify({    includeFiles: ['./my-data.json'], // relative to `root`  }),});
```

#### excludeFiles

[Section titled “excludeFiles”](#excludefiles)

**Type:** `string[]`
 **Default:** `[]`

 **Added in:** `astro@5.3.0`

You can use the `excludeFiles` property to prevent specific files from being bundled that would otherwise be included. This is helpful for:

- Reducing bundle size
- Excluding large binaries
- Preventing unwanted files from being deployed

Provide an array of specific files to exclude with file paths relative to your project’s [root](https://docs.astro.build/en/reference/configuration-reference/#root). Absolute paths may not work as expected.

 astro.config.mjs

```
import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';import netlify from '@astrojs/netlify';
export default defineConfig({  // ...  adapter: netlify({    excludeFiles: ['./src/some_big_file.jpg'], // relative to `root`  }),});
```

#### Using glob patterns

[Section titled “Using glob patterns”](#using-glob-patterns)

Both `includeFiles` and `excludeFiles` support [glob patterns](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/imports/#glob-patterns) for matching multiple files:

 astro.config.mjs

```
import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';import netlify from '@astrojs/netlify';
export default defineConfig({  adapter: netlify({    includeFiles: [      './data/**/*.json'    ],    excludeFiles: [      './node_modules/package/**/*',      './src/**/*.test.js'    ]  }),});
```

### Local development features

[Section titled “Local development features”](#local-development-features)

When running `astro dev`, the adapter enables several Netlify platform features to ensure the environment matches production as closely as possible. These include:

- A local [Netlify Image CDN](https://docs.netlify.com/build/image-cdn/overview/) server. This is used for [images](#netlify-image-cdn-support) by default.
- A local [Netlify Blobs](https://docs.netlify.com/build/data-and-storage/netlify-blobs/) server. This is used for [sessions](#sessions) by default
- [Redirects, rewrites](https://docs.netlify.com/manage/routing/redirects/overview/) and [headers](https://docs.netlify.com/manage/routing/headers/) from your Netlify config
- Access to [Netlify Edge Context](#accessing-edge-context-from-your-site) in on-demand pages
- [Environment variables](https://docs.netlify.com/build/environment-variables/overview/) from your Netlify site

These work best when your local site is [linked to a Netlify site](https://docs.netlify.com/api-and-cli-guides/cli-guides/get-started-with-cli/#link-and-unlink-sites) using `netlify link`.

You can enable or disable some of these features using the [devFeatures](#devfeatures) option in your adapter configuration. By default, all features are enabled except for environment variables.

#### devFeatures

[Section titled “devFeatures”](#devfeatures)

**Type:** `boolean | object`
 **Default:** `{ images: true, environmentVariables: false }`

 **Added in:** `@astrojs/netlify@6.5.1`

The `devFeatures` option can be either a boolean to enable or disable all features, or an object to enable specific features.

 astro.config.mjs

```
import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';import netlify from '@astrojs/netlify';
export default defineConfig({  // ...  adapter: netlify({    devFeatures: {      // Enable Netlify Image CDN support in dev. Defaults to true.      images: false,      // Inject Netlify environment variables in dev. Defaults to false.      environmentVariables: true,    },  }),});
```

##### devFeatures.images

[Section titled “devFeatures.images”](#devfeaturesimages)

**Type:** `boolean`
 **Default:** `true`

 **Added in:** `@astrojs/netlify@6.5.1`

Enables support for the local [Netlify Image CDN](https://docs.netlify.com/build/image-cdn/overview/) in development.

This uses a local version of the Netlify Image CDN, rather than the default Astro image service.

##### devFeatures.environmentVariables

[Section titled “devFeatures.environmentVariables”](#devfeaturesenvironmentvariables)

**Type:** `boolean`
 **Default:** `false`

 **Added in:** `@astrojs/netlify@6.5.1`

Injects environment variables from your Netlify site into the development environment.

This allows you to use the same values in development as you would in production. See [the Netlify docs on environment variables](https://docs.netlify.com/build/environment-variables/overview/) for more information, including how to use different variables for different environments.

## Experimental features

[Section titled “Experimental features”](#experimental-features)

The following features are also available for use, but may be subject to breaking changes in future updates. Please follow the [@astrojs/netlifyCHANGELOG](https://github.com/withastro/astro/tree/main/packages/integrations/netlify/CHANGELOG.md) carefully for updates if you are using these features in your project.

### experimentalStaticHeaders

[Section titled “experimentalStaticHeaders”](#experimentalstaticheaders)

**Type:** `boolean`
 **Default:** `false`

 **Added in:** `@astrojs/netlify@6.4.0`

Enables specifying custom headers for prerendered pages in Netlify’s configuration.

If enabled, the adapter will save [static headers in the Framework API config file](https://docs.netlify.com/frameworks-api/#headers) when provided by Astro features, such as Content Security Policy.

For example, when [experimental Content Security Policy](https://docs.astro.build/en/reference/experimental-flags/csp/) is enabled, `experimentalStaticHeaders` can be used to add the CSP `headers` to your Netlify configuration, instead of creating a `<meta>` element:

 astro.config.mjs

```
import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';import netlify from '@astrojs/netlify';
export default defineConfig({  experimental: {    csp: true  },  adapter: netlify({    experimentalStaticHeaders: true  })});
```

## Examples

[Section titled “Examples”](#examples)

# @astrojs/node

> Learn how to use the @astrojs/node adapter to deploy your Astro project.

# @astrojs/node

  v9.5.2 [GitHub](https://github.com/withastro/astro/tree/main/packages/integrations/node/) [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@astrojs/node) [Changelog](https://github.com/withastro/astro/tree/main/packages/integrations/node/CHANGELOG.md)

This adapter allows Astro to deploy your [on-demand rendered routes and features](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/on-demand-rendering/) to Node targets, including [server islands](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/server-islands/), [actions](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/actions/), and [sessions](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/sessions/).

If you’re using Astro as a static site builder, you don’t need an adapter.

## Why Astro Node.js

[Section titled “Why Astro Node.js”](#why-astro-nodejs)

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) is a JavaScript runtime for server-side code. @astrojs/node can be used either in standalone mode or as middleware for other http servers, such as [Express](https://expressjs.com/).

## Installation

[Section titled “Installation”](#installation)

Astro includes an `astro add` command to automate the setup of official integrations. If you prefer, you can [install integrations manually](#manual-install) instead.

Add the Node adapter to enable on-demand rendering in your Astro project with the `astro add` command.
This will install `@astrojs/node` and make the appropriate changes to your `astro.config.*` file in one step.

- [npm](#tab-panel-2983)
- [pnpm](#tab-panel-2984)
- [Yarn](#tab-panel-2985)

   Terminal window

```
npx astro add node
```

   Terminal window

```
pnpm astro add node
```

   Terminal window

```
yarn astro add node
```

Now, you can enable [on-demand rendering per page](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/on-demand-rendering/#enabling-on-demand-rendering), or set your build output configuration to `output: 'server'` to [server-render all your pages by default](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/on-demand-rendering/#server-mode).

### Manual Install

[Section titled “Manual Install”](#manual-install)

First, add the Node adapter to your project’s dependencies using your preferred package manager.

- [npm](#tab-panel-2986)
- [pnpm](#tab-panel-2987)
- [Yarn](#tab-panel-2988)

   Terminal window

```
npm install @astrojs/node
```

   Terminal window

```
pnpm add @astrojs/node
```

   Terminal window

```
yarn add @astrojs/node
```

Then, add the adapter to your `astro.config.*` file:

 astro.config.mjs

```
import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';import node from '@astrojs/node';
export default defineConfig({  adapter: node({    mode: 'standalone',  }),});
```

## Configuration

[Section titled “Configuration”](#configuration)

@astrojs/node can be configured by passing options into the adapter function. The following options are available:

### mode

[Section titled “mode”](#mode)

**Type:** `'middleware' | 'standalone'`

Controls whether the adapter builds to `middleware` or `standalone` mode.

- `middleware` mode allows the built output to be used as middleware for another Node.js server, like Express.js or Fastify.
- `standalone` mode builds a server that automatically starts when the entry module is run. This allows you to more easily deploy your build to a host without needing additional code.

 astro.config.mjs

```
import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';import node from '@astrojs/node';
export default defineConfig({  adapter: node({    mode: 'middleware',  }),});
```

### experimentalDisableStreaming

[Section titled “experimentalDisableStreaming”](#experimentaldisablestreaming)

**Type:** `boolean`
 **Default:** `false`

 **Added in:** `@astrojs/node@9.3.0`

Disables Astro’s default [HTML streaming](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/on-demand-rendering/#html-streaming) for pages rendered on demand.

HTML streaming helps with performance and generally provides a better visitor experience. In most cases, disabling streaming is not recommended.

However, when you need to disable HTML streaming (e.g. your host only supports non-streamed HTML caching at the CDN level), you can opt out of the default behavior:

 astro.config.mjs

```
import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';import node from '@astrojs/node';
export default defineConfig({  adapter: node({    mode: 'standalone',    experimentalDisableStreaming: true,  }),});
```

### experimentalStaticHeaders

[Section titled “experimentalStaticHeaders”](#experimentalstaticheaders)

**Type:** `boolean`
 **Default:** `false`

 **Added in:** `@astrojs/node@9.3.0`

If enabled, the adapter will serve the headers of prerendered pages using the `Response` object when provided by Astro features, such as Content Security Policy.

For example, when [experimental Content Security Policy](https://docs.astro.build/en/reference/experimental-flags/csp/) is enabled, `experimentalStaticHeaders` can be used to add the CSP headers to the `Response` object instead of creating a `<meta>` element:

 astro.config.mjs

```
import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';import node from '@astrojs/node';
export default defineConfig({  experimental: {    csp: true  },  adapter: node({    mode: 'standalone',    experimentalStaticHeaders: true,  })});
```

### experimentalErrorPageHost

[Section titled “experimentalErrorPageHost”](#experimentalerrorpagehost)

**Type:** `string | URL`
 **Default:** `undefined`

 **Added in:** `@astrojs/node@9.4.0`

Specifies an alternate host for loading prerendered [custom error pages](https://docs.astro.build/en/basics/astro-pages/#custom-404-error-page).

Astro needs to be able to load your 404 page in order to return it in a response. By default, Astro will load prerendered custom error pages from the same host as the one that the request is made to. For example, if a request is made to `https://example.com/nonexistent-page`, Astro will attempt to load the prerendered error page from `https://example.com/404.html`.

Use `experimentalErrorPageHost` when your custom error page must be loaded from a different host, such as when the server is running behind a reverse proxy or in a container that may not have access to the external host URL. You can also use this when it is more efficient to load the prerendered error page from localhost rather than via the public internet.

The value can be a string or a URL object. It must be a fully-qualified URL, including the protocol (e.g., `http://localhost:4321`). Astro will always load the prerendered error page from the root path, and any path or query parameters will be ignored.

```
import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';import node from '@astrojs/node';
export default defineConfig({  adapter: node({    // Load pages from localhost, not the public URL.    experimentalErrorPageHost: 'http://localhost:4321',  })});
```

## Usage

[Section titled “Usage”](#usage)

First, [performing a build](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/deploy/#building-your-site-locally). Depending on which `mode` selected (see above) follow the appropriate steps below:

### Middleware

[Section titled “Middleware”](#middleware)

The server entrypoint is built to `./dist/server/entry.mjs` by default. This module exports a `handler` function that can be used with any framework that supports the Node `request` and `response` objects.

For example, with Express:

 run-server.mjs

```
import express from 'express';import { handler as ssrHandler } from './dist/server/entry.mjs';
const app = express();// Change this based on your astro.config.mjs, `base` option.// They should match. The default value is "/".const base = '/';app.use(base, express.static('dist/client/'));app.use(ssrHandler);
app.listen(8080);
```

Or, with Fastify (>4):

 run-server.mjs

```
import Fastify from 'fastify';import fastifyMiddie from '@fastify/middie';import fastifyStatic from '@fastify/static';import { fileURLToPath } from 'node:url';import { handler as ssrHandler } from './dist/server/entry.mjs';
const app = Fastify({ logger: true });
await app  .register(fastifyStatic, {    root: fileURLToPath(new URL('./dist/client', import.meta.url)),  })  .register(fastifyMiddie);app.use(ssrHandler);
app.listen({ port: 8080 });
```

Additionally, you can also pass in an object to be accessed with `Astro.locals` or in Astro middleware:

 run-server.mjs

```
import express from 'express';import { handler as ssrHandler } from './dist/server/entry.mjs';
const app = express();app.use(express.static('dist/client/'));app.use((req, res, next) => {  const locals = {    title: 'New title',  };
  ssrHandler(req, res, next, locals);});
app.listen(8080);
```

Note that middleware mode does not do file serving. You’ll need to configure your HTTP framework to do that for you. By default the client assets are written to `./dist/client/`.

### Standalone

[Section titled “Standalone”](#standalone)

In standalone mode a server starts when the server entrypoint is run. By default it is built to `./dist/server/entry.mjs`. You can run it with:

 Terminal window

```
node ./dist/server/entry.mjs
```

For standalone mode the server handles file serving in addition to the page and API routes.

#### Custom host and port

[Section titled “Custom host and port”](#custom-host-and-port)

You can override the host and port the standalone server runs on by passing them as environment variables at runtime:

 Terminal window

```
HOST=0.0.0.0 PORT=4321 node ./dist/server/entry.mjs
```

#### HTTPS

[Section titled “HTTPS”](#https)

By default the standalone server uses HTTP. This works well if you have a proxy server in front of it that does HTTPS. If you need the standalone server to run HTTPS itself you need to provide your SSL key and certificate.

You can pass the path to your key and certification via the environment variables `SERVER_CERT_PATH` and `SERVER_KEY_PATH`. This is how you might pass them in bash:

 Terminal window

```
SERVER_KEY_PATH=./private/key.pem SERVER_CERT_PATH=./private/cert.pem node ./dist/server/entry.mjs
```

#### Assets

[Section titled “Assets”](#assets)

In standalone mode, assets in your `dist/client/` folder are served via the standalone server. You might be deploying these assets to a CDN, in which case the server will never actually be serving them. But in some cases, such as intranet sites, it’s fine to serve static assets directly from the application server.

Assets in the `dist/client/_astro/` folder are the ones that Astro has built. These assets are all named with a hash and therefore can be given long cache headers. Internally the adapter adds this header for these assets:

```
Cache-Control: public, max-age=31536000, immutable
```

## Sessions

[Section titled “Sessions”](#sessions)

The Astro [Sessions API](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/sessions/) allows you to easily store user data between requests. This can be used for things like user data and preferences, shopping carts, and authentication credentials. Unlike cookie storage, there are no size limits on the data, and it can be restored on different devices.

Astro uses the local filesystem for session storage when using the Node adapter. If you would prefer to use a different session storage driver, you can specify it in your Astro config. See [thesessionconfiguration reference](https://docs.astro.build/en/reference/configuration-reference/#sessiondriver) for more details.

## Environment variables

[Section titled “Environment variables”](#environment-variables)

When using the [astro:env](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/environment-variables/#type-safe-environment-variables) secrets or `process.env` at runtime, neither Astro nor the adapter loads environment variables for you.

Some hosts may expose the environment variables you configure through their dashboard during the build and at runtime. Check your host’s documentation for setting and using environment variables within the specific platform.

When self-hosting, you can load environment variables through CLI commands or configuration files as appropriate:

- [Inline](#tab-panel-2980)
- [dotenvx](#tab-panel-2981)
- [Docker](#tab-panel-2982)

   Terminal window

```
DB_HOST=... DB_PASSWORD=... node ./dist/server/entry.mjs
```

  Terminal window

```
npx @dotenvx/dotenvx run -- node ./dist/server/entry.mjs
```

  Dockerfile

```
FROM node:lts AS runtimeWORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN npm installRUN npm run build
ENV DB_HOST=...ENV DB_PASSWORD=...CMD node ./dist/server/entry.mjs
```

# @astrojs/partytown

> Learn how to use the @astrojs/partytown integration in your Astro project.

# @astrojs/partytown

  v2.1.4 [GitHub](https://github.com/withastro/astro/tree/main/packages/integrations/partytown/) [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@astrojs/partytown) [Changelog](https://github.com/withastro/astro/tree/main/packages/integrations/partytown/CHANGELOG.md)

This **Astro integration** enables [Partytown](https://partytown.qwik.dev/) in your Astro project.

## Why Astro Partytown

[Section titled “Why Astro Partytown”](#why-astro-partytown)

Partytown is a lazy-loaded library to help relocate resource intensive scripts into a [web worker](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API), and off of the [main thread](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Main_thread).

If you’re using third-party scripts for things like analytics or ads, Partytown is a great way to make sure that they don’t slow down your site.

The Astro Partytown integration installs Partytown for you and makes sure it’s enabled on all of your pages.

## Installation

[Section titled “Installation”](#installation)

Astro includes an `astro add` command to automate the setup of official integrations. If you prefer, you can [install integrations manually](#manual-install) instead.

Run one of the following commands in a new terminal window.

- [npm](#tab-panel-2989)
- [pnpm](#tab-panel-2990)
- [Yarn](#tab-panel-2991)

   Terminal window

```
npx astro add partytown
```

   Terminal window

```
pnpm astro add partytown
```

   Terminal window

```
yarn astro add partytown
```

If you run into any issues, [feel free to report them to us on GitHub](https://github.com/withastro/astro/issues) and try the manual installation steps below.

### Manual Install

[Section titled “Manual Install”](#manual-install)

First, install the `@astrojs/partytown` package:

- [npm](#tab-panel-2992)
- [pnpm](#tab-panel-2993)
- [Yarn](#tab-panel-2994)

   Terminal window

```
npm install @astrojs/partytown
```

   Terminal window

```
pnpm add @astrojs/partytown
```

   Terminal window

```
yarn add @astrojs/partytown
```

Then, apply the integration to your `astro.config.*` file using the `integrations` property:

 astro.config.mjs

```
import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';import partytown from '@astrojs/partytown';
export default defineConfig({  // ...  integrations: [partytown()],});
```

## Usage

[Section titled “Usage”](#usage)

Partytown should be ready to go with zero config. If you have an existing 3rd party script on your site, try adding the `type="text/partytown"` attribute:

```
<script type="text/partytown" src="fancy-analytics.js"></script>
```

If you open the “Network” tab from [your browser’s dev tools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/open/), you should see the `partytown` proxy intercepting this request.

## Configuration

[Section titled “Configuration”](#configuration)

To configure this integration, pass a ‘config’ object to the `partytown()` function call in `astro.config.mjs`.

 astro.config.mjs

```
export default defineConfig({  // ...  integrations: [    partytown({      config: {        // options go here      },    }),  ],});
```

This mirrors the [Partytown config object](https://partytown.qwik.dev/configuration/) and all options can be set in `partytown.config`. Some common configuration options for Astro projects are described on this page.

### Enabling debug mode

[Section titled “Enabling debug mode”](#enabling-debug-mode)

Partytown ships with a `debug` mode; enable or disable it by passing `true` or `false` to `config.debug`. If [debugmode](https://partytown.qwik.dev/debugging) is enabled, it will output detailed logs to the browser console.

If this option isn’t set, `debug` mode will be on by default in [dev](https://docs.astro.build/en/reference/cli-reference/#astro-dev) or [preview](https://docs.astro.build/en/reference/cli-reference/#astro-preview) mode.

 astro.config.mjs

```
export default defineConfig({  // ...  integrations: [    partytown({      // Example: Disable debug mode.      config: { debug: false },    }),  ],});
```

### Forwarding variables

[Section titled “Forwarding variables”](#forwarding-variables)

Third-party scripts typically add variables to the `window` object so that you can communicate with them throughout your site. But when a script is loaded in a web-worker, it doesn’t have access to that global `window` object.

To solve this, Partytown can “patch” variables to the global window object and forward them to the appropriate script.

You can specify which variables to forward with the `config.forward` option. [Read more in Partytown’s documentation.](https://partytown.qwik.dev/forwarding-events)

 astro.config.mjs

```
export default defineConfig({  // ...  integrations: [    partytown({      // Example: Add dataLayer.push as a forwarding-event.      config: {        forward: ['dataLayer.push'],      },    }),  ],});
```

### Proxying requests

[Section titled “Proxying requests”](#proxying-requests)

Some third-party scripts may require [proxying](https://partytown.qwik.dev/proxying-requests/) through `config.resolveUrl()`, which runs inside the service worker. You can set this configuration option to check for a specific URL, and optionally return a proxied URL instead:

 astro.config.mjs

```
export default defineConfig({  // ...  integrations: [    partytown({      // Example: proxy Facebook's analytics script      config: {        resolveUrl: (url) => {          const proxyMap = {            "connect.facebook.net": "my-proxy.com"          }          url.hostname = proxyMap[url.hostname] || url.hostname;          return url;        },      }    }),  ],});
```

However since the `config` object is serialized when sent to the client, some limitations on functions passed to your configuration apply:

- Functions cannot reference anything outside of the function scope.
- Functions can only be written in JavaScript.

In some advanced use cases, you may need to pass data to this function while initializing Partytown. To do so, you can set `resolveUrl()` on `window.partytown` instead of the integration config:

 Head.astro

```
---const proxyMap = {  "connect.facebook.net": "my-proxy.com"};---
<script is:inline set:html={`  window.partytown = {    resolveUrl: (url) => {      const proxyMap = ${JSON.stringify(proxyMap)};      url.hostname = proxyMap[url.hostname] || url.hostname;      return url;    },  };`} />
```

Note that the integration config will override `window.partytown` if you set a property in both.

# @astrojs/preact

> Learn how to use the @astrojs/preact framework integration to extend component support in your Astro project.

# @astrojs/preact

  v4.1.3 [GitHub](https://github.com/withastro/astro/tree/main/packages/integrations/preact/) [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@astrojs/preact) [Changelog](https://github.com/withastro/astro/tree/main/packages/integrations/preact/CHANGELOG.md)

This **Astro integration** enables rendering and client-side hydration for your [Preact](https://preactjs.com/) components.

## Why Preact?

[Section titled “Why Preact?”](#why-preact)

Preact is a library that lets you build interactive UI components for the web. If you want to build interactive features on your site using JavaScript, you may prefer using its component format instead of using browser APIs directly.

Preact is also a great choice if you have previously used React. Preact provides the same API as React, but in a much smaller 3kB package. It even supports rendering many React components using the `compat` configuration option (see below).

**Want to learn more about Preact before using this integration?**

Check out [“Learn Preact”](https://preactjs.com/tutorial), an interactive tutorial on their website.

## Installation

[Section titled “Installation”](#installation)

Astro includes an `astro add` command to automate the setup of official integrations. If you prefer, you can [install integrations manually](#manual-install) instead.

To install `@astrojs/preact`, run the following from your project directory and follow the prompts:

- [npm](#tab-panel-2995)
- [pnpm](#tab-panel-2996)
- [Yarn](#tab-panel-2997)

   Terminal window

```
npx astro add preact
```

   Terminal window

```
pnpm astro add preact
```

   Terminal window

```
yarn astro add preact
```

If you run into any issues, [feel free to report them to us on GitHub](https://github.com/withastro/astro/issues) and try the manual installation steps below.

### Manual Install

[Section titled “Manual Install”](#manual-install)

First, install the `@astrojs/preact` package:

- [npm](#tab-panel-2998)
- [pnpm](#tab-panel-2999)
- [Yarn](#tab-panel-3000)

   Terminal window

```
npm install @astrojs/preact
```

   Terminal window

```
pnpm add @astrojs/preact
```

   Terminal window

```
yarn add @astrojs/preact
```

Most package managers will install associated peer dependencies as well. If you see a `Cannot find package 'preact'` (or similar) warning when you start up Astro, you’ll need to install Preact:

- [npm](#tab-panel-3001)
- [pnpm](#tab-panel-3002)
- [Yarn](#tab-panel-3003)

   Terminal window

```
npm install preact
```

   Terminal window

```
pnpm add preact
```

   Terminal window

```
yarn add preact
```

Then, apply the integration to your `astro.config.*` file using the `integrations` property:

 astro.config.mjs

```
import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';import preact from '@astrojs/preact';
export default defineConfig({  // ...  integrations: [preact()],});
```

And add the following code to the `tsconfig.json` file.

 tsconfig.json

```
{  "extends": "astro/tsconfigs/strict",  "include": [".astro/types.d.ts", "**/*"],  "exclude": ["dist"],  "compilerOptions": {    "jsx": "react-jsx",    "jsxImportSource": "preact"  }}
```

## Usage

[Section titled “Usage”](#usage)

To use your first Preact component in Astro, head to our [UI framework documentation](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/framework-components/#using-framework-components). You’ll explore:

- 📦 how framework components are loaded,
- 💧 client-side hydration options, and
- 🤝 opportunities to mix and nest frameworks together

Also check our [Astro Integration Documentation](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/) for more on integrations.

## Configuration

[Section titled “Configuration”](#configuration)

The Astro Preact integration handles how Preact components are rendered and it has its own options. Change these in the `astro.config.mjs` file which is where your project’s integration settings live.

For basic usage, you do not need to configure the Preact integration.

### compat

[Section titled “compat”](#compat)

**Type:** `boolean`

 **Added in:** `@astrojs/preact@0.3.0`

You can enable `preact/compat`, Preact’s compatibility layer for rendering React components without needing to install or ship React’s larger libraries to your users’ web browsers.

To do so, pass an object to the Preact integration and set `compat: true`.

 astro.config.mjs

```
import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';import preact from '@astrojs/preact';
export default defineConfig({  integrations: [preact({ compat: true })],});
```

With the `compat` option enabled, the Preact integration will render React components as well as Preact components in your project and also allow you to import React components inside Preact components. Read more in [“Switching to Preact (from React)”](https://preactjs.com/guide/v10/switching-to-preact) on the Preact website.

When importing React component libraries, in order to swap out the `react` and `react-dom` dependencies as `preact/compat`, you can use [overrides](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/configuring-npm/package-json#overrides) to do so.

 package.json

```
{  "overrides": {    "react": "npm:@preact/compat@latest",    "react-dom": "npm:@preact/compat@latest"  }}
```

Check out the [pnpmoverrides](https://pnpm.io/package_json#pnpmoverrides) and [yarnresolutions](https://yarnpkg.com/configuration/manifest#resolutions) docs for their respective overrides features.

### devtools

[Section titled “devtools”](#devtools)

**Type:** `boolean`

 **Added in:** `@astrojs/preact@3.3.0`

You can enable [Preact devtools](https://preactjs.github.io/preact-devtools/) in development by passing an object with `devtools: true` to your `preact()` integration config:

 astro.config.mjs

```
import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';import preact from '@astrojs/preact';
export default defineConfig({  // ...  integrations: [preact({ devtools: true })],});
```

## Options

[Section titled “Options”](#options)

### Combining multiple JSX frameworks

[Section titled “Combining multiple JSX frameworks”](#combining-multiple-jsx-frameworks)

When you are using multiple JSX frameworks (React, Preact, Solid) in the same project, Astro needs to determine which JSX framework-specific transformations should be used for each of your components. If you have only added one JSX framework integration to your project, no extra configuration is needed.

Use the `include` (required) and `exclude` (optional) configuration options to specify which files belong to which framework. Provide an array of files and/or folders to `include` for each framework you are using. Wildcards may be used to include multiple file paths.

We recommend placing common framework components in the same folder (e.g. `/components/react/` and `/components/solid/`) to make specifying your includes easier, but this is not required:

 astro.config.mjs

```
import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';import preact from '@astrojs/preact';import react from '@astrojs/react';import svelte from '@astrojs/svelte';import vue from '@astrojs/vue';import solid from '@astrojs/solid-js';
export default defineConfig({  // Enable many frameworks to support all different kinds of components.  // No `include` is needed if you are only using a single JSX framework!  integrations: [    preact({      include: ['**/preact/*'],    }),    react({      include: ['**/react/*'],    }),    solid({      include: ['**/solid/*'],    }),  ],});
```

## Examples

[Section titled “Examples”](#examples)

- The [Astro Preact example](https://github.com/withastro/astro/tree/latest/examples/framework-preact) shows how to use an interactive Preact component in an Astro project.
- The [Astro Nanostores example](https://github.com/withastro/astro/tree/latest/examples/with-nanostores) shows how to share state between different components — and even different frameworks! — in an Astro project.
