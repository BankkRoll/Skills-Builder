This page describes how to create, edit, and restrict API keys. For information
about how to use API keys to access Google APIs, see
[Use API keys to access APIs](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/api-keys-use).

## Introduction to API keys

There are two types of API keys: standard API keys, and API keys that have been
bound to a service account.

### Standard API keys

Standard API keys provide a way to associate a request with a project for
billing and quota purposes. When you use a standard API key (an API key that has
not been bound to a service account) to access an API, the API key doesn't
identify a [principal](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication#principal). Without a principal, the
request can't use Identity and Access Management (IAM) to check whether the caller is
authorized to perform the requested operation.

Standard API keys can be used with any API that accepts API keys, unless API
restrictions have been added to the key. Standard API keys can't be used with
services that don't accept API keys, including in
[express mode](https://cloud.google.com/resources/cloud-express-faqs).

### API keys bound to a service account

API keys bound to a service account provide the identity and authorization of
the service account to a request. When you use an API key that has been bound to
a service account to access an API, your request is processed as if you used the
bound service account to make the request.

The only API that supports bound API keys is `aiplatform.googleapis.com`.

Binding keys to a service account is prevented by a default organization policy
constraint. To change this, see
[Enable key binding to service accounts](#enable-key-binding).

### API key components

An API key has the following components, which let you manage and use the
key:

  String The API key string is an encrypted string, for example,
`AIzaSyDaGmWKa4JsXZ-HjGw7ISLn_3namBGewQe`. When you use an API key to
access an API, you always use the key's string. API keys don't have an
associated JSON file. ID The API key ID is used by Google Cloud administrative tools to uniquely
identify the key. The key ID can't be used to access APIs. The key ID can be
found in the URL of the key's edit page in the Google Cloud console. You can also
get the key ID by using the Google Cloud CLI to list the keys in your project. Display name The display name is an optional, descriptive name for the key,
which you can set when you create or update the key. Bound service account API keys that are bound to a service account include the service account's
email address.

## Before you begin

Complete the following tasks to use the samples on this page.

### Set up authentication

Select the tab for how you plan to use the samples on this page:

When you use the Google Cloud console to access Google Cloud services and
        APIs, you don't need to set up authentication.

In the Google Cloud console, activate Cloud Shell.

[Activate Cloud Shell](https://console.cloud.google.com/?cloudshell=true)

At the bottom of the Google Cloud console, a
      [Cloud Shell](https://cloud.google.com/shell/docs/how-cloud-shell-works)
      session starts and displays a command-line prompt. Cloud Shell is a shell environment
      with the Google Cloud CLI
      already installed and with values already set for
      your current project. It can take a few seconds for the session to initialize.

To use the C++ samples on this page in a local
      development environment, install and initialize the gcloud CLI, and
      then set up Application Default Credentials with your user credentials.

1. [Install](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install) the Google Cloud CLI.
2. If you're using an external identity provider (IdP), you must first
              [sign in to the gcloud CLI with your federated identity](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/workforce-log-in-gcloud).
3. If you're using a local shell, then create local authentication credentials for your user
          account:
  ```
  gcloud auth application-default login
  ```
  You don't need to do this if you're using Cloud Shell.
  If an authentication error is returned, and you are using an external identity provider
          (IdP), confirm that you have
          [signed in to the gcloud CLI with your federated identity](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/workforce-log-in-gcloud).

For more information, see
    [Set up ADC for a local development environment](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/set-up-adc-local-dev-environment)
    in the Google Cloud authentication documentation.

To use the Java samples on this page in a local
      development environment, install and initialize the gcloud CLI, and
      then set up Application Default Credentials with your user credentials.

1. [Install](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install) the Google Cloud CLI.
2. If you're using an external identity provider (IdP), you must first
              [sign in to the gcloud CLI with your federated identity](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/workforce-log-in-gcloud).
3. If you're using a local shell, then create local authentication credentials for your user
          account:
  ```
  gcloud auth application-default login
  ```
  You don't need to do this if you're using Cloud Shell.
  If an authentication error is returned, and you are using an external identity provider
          (IdP), confirm that you have
          [signed in to the gcloud CLI with your federated identity](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/workforce-log-in-gcloud).

For more information, see
    [Set up ADC for a local development environment](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/set-up-adc-local-dev-environment)
    in the Google Cloud authentication documentation.

To use the Python samples on this page in a local
      development environment, install and initialize the gcloud CLI, and
      then set up Application Default Credentials with your user credentials.

1. [Install](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install) the Google Cloud CLI.
2. If you're using an external identity provider (IdP), you must first
              [sign in to the gcloud CLI with your federated identity](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/workforce-log-in-gcloud).
3. If you're using a local shell, then create local authentication credentials for your user
          account:
  ```
  gcloud auth application-default login
  ```
  You don't need to do this if you're using Cloud Shell.
  If an authentication error is returned, and you are using an external identity provider
          (IdP), confirm that you have
          [signed in to the gcloud CLI with your federated identity](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/workforce-log-in-gcloud).

For more information, see
    [Set up ADC for a local development environment](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/set-up-adc-local-dev-environment)
    in the Google Cloud authentication documentation.

To use the REST API samples on this page in a local development environment, you use the
    credentials you provide to the gcloud CLI.

For more information, see
  [Authenticate for using REST](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/rest)
  in the Google Cloud authentication documentation.

### Required roles

To get the permissions that
      you need to manage API keys,

      ask your administrator to grant you the
    following IAM roles on your project:

- [API Keys Admin](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/roles-permissions/serviceusage#serviceusage.apiKeysAdmin) (`roles/serviceusage.apiKeysAdmin`)
- Restrict an API key to specific APIs by using the Google Cloud console:
        [Service Usage Viewer](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/roles-permissions/serviceusage#serviceusage.serviceUsageViewer) (`roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageViewer`)

For more information about granting roles, see [Manage access to projects, folders, and organizations](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/granting-changing-revoking-access).

You might also be able to get
        the required permissions through [custom
        roles](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-custom-roles) or other [predefined
        roles](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/roles-overview#predefined).

### Enable key binding to service accounts

Before you can [bind an API key to a service account](#api-keys-bound-sa), you
first need to set the
`constraints/iam.managed.disableServiceAccountApiKeyCreation` organization
policy constraint to `false`. Changing the organization policy requires an
associated
[organization resource](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/cloud-platform-resource-hierarchy#organizations).
Projects without an organization aren't supported.

To change the policy constraint, complete the following instructions.

1. In the Google Cloud console, go to the **Organization policies** page.
  [Go to Organization policies](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/orgpolicies/list)
2. Switch to the organization, folder, or project you want to change the
  policies for.
3. In the **Filter** box, enter `Block service`, and then click the filter
  name **Block service account API key bindings**.
4. Click **Manage policy**.
5. In the **Policy source** section, select **Override parent's policy**.
6. Click **Add a rule**, and set **Enforcement** to **Off**.
7. Click **Done**.
8. Optional: Click **Test changes** to give you insight on how the proposed
  policy might cause compliance violations or disruptions.
9. Click **Set policy**.

1. Create a file named `spec.yaml`, with the following content:
  ```
  name: SCOPE/SCOPE_ID/policies/iam.managed.disableServiceAccountApiKeyCreation
  spec:
    rules:
    - enforce: false
  ```
  Provide the following values:
  - `SCOPE`: Either `organizations`, `folders`, or
    `projects`.
  - `SCOPE_ID`: Depending on SCOPE, the ID of
    the organization, folder, or project to which the organization policy
    applies.
2. Run the following `gcloud` command to allow binding of API keys to service
  accounts:
  ```
  gcloud org-policies set-policy spec.yaml \
      --update-mask spec
  ```

## Create an API key

To create an API key, use one of the following options:

1. In the Google Cloud console, go to the **Credentials** page:
  [Go to Credentials](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials)
2. Click **Create credentials**, and then select **API key** from the menu.
3. Optional: To bind the API key to a service account, select the
  **Authenticate API calls through a service account** checkbox and then
  click **Select a service account** to select the service account you want
  to bind to the key.
  For more information, see
  [API keys bound to a service account](#api-keys-bound-sa).
4. Add API key restrictions.
  Restricting API keys is a best practice. For more information, see
  [Apply API key restrictions](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/api-keys#api_key_restrictions).
5. Click **Create**. The **API key created** dialog displays the string for
  your newly created key.

You use the
 [gcloud services api-keys createcommand](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/services/api-keys/create)
 to create an API key.

Replace `DISPLAY_NAME` with a descriptive name for
 your key.

```
gcloud services api-keys create \
     --display-name=DISPLAY_NAME
```

Optional: To bind the API key to a service account, use `gcloud beta`
 instead, with the `--service-account` flag:

```
gcloud beta services api-keys create \
     --display-name=DISPLAY_NAME \
     --service-account=SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL_ADDRESS
```

For more information, see
 [API keys bound to a service account](#api-keys-bound-sa).

To run this sample, you must install the
[API Keys client library](https://cloud.google.com/cpp/docs/reference/apikeys/latest).

```
#include "google/cloud/apikeys/v2/api_keys_client.h"
#include "google/cloud/location.h"

google::api::apikeys::v2::Key CreateApiKey(
    google::cloud::apikeys_v2::ApiKeysClient client,
    google::cloud::Location location, std::string display_name) {
  google::api::apikeys::v2::CreateKeyRequest request;
  request.set_parent(location.FullName());
  request.mutable_key()->set_display_name(std::move(display_name));
  // As an example, restrict the API key's scope to the Natural Language API.
  request.mutable_key()->mutable_restrictions()->add_api_targets()->set_service(
      "language.googleapis.com");

  // Create the key, blocking on the result.
  auto key = client.CreateKey(request).get();
  if (!key) throw std::move(key.status());
  std::cout << "Successfully created an API key: " << key->name() << "\n";

  // For authenticating with the API key, use the value in `key->key_string()`.

  // The API key's resource name is the value in `key->name()`. Use this to
  // refer to the specific key in a `GetKey()` or `DeleteKey()` RPC.

For more information about creating API keys using the REST API, see
[Creating an API key](https://cloud.google.com/api-keys/docs/create-manage-api-keys#create) in the
API Keys API documentation.

## Apply API key restrictions

API keys are unrestricted by default. Unrestricted keys are insecure because
they can be used by anyone from anywhere. For production applications, you
should set both [application restrictions](#adding-application-restrictions) and
[API restrictions](#adding-api-restrictions).

### Add application restrictions

Application restrictions specify which websites, IP addresses, or apps can use
an API key.

You can apply only one application restriction type at a time. Choose the
restriction type based on your application type:

| Option | Application type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Websites | Web applications | Specifies the websites that can use the key. |
| IP addresses | Applications called by specific servers | Specifies the servers or cron jobs that can use the key. This is the only restriction available if you bind your API key to a service account. |
| Android apps | Android applications | Specifies the Android application that can use the key. |
| iOS apps | iOS applications | Specifies the iOS bundles that can use the key. |

#### Websites

To restrict the websites that can use your API key, you add one or more HTTP
referrer restrictions.

You can substitute a wildcard character (`*`) for the subdomain or the path, but
you can't insert a wildcard character into the middle of a URL. For example,
`*.example.com` is valid, and accepts all sites ending in `.example.com`.
However, `mysubdomain*.example.com` is not a valid restriction.

Port numbers can be included in HTTP referrer restrictions. If you include a
port number, then only requests using that port are matched. If you don't
specify a port number, then requests from any port number are matched.

The following table shows some example scenarios and browser restrictions:

| Scenario | Restrictions |
| --- | --- |
| Allow a specific URL | Add a URL with an exact path. For example:www.example.com/pathwww.example.com/path/pathSome browsers implement areferrer policythat sends only the origin URL for cross-origin requests.
  Users of these browsers can't use keys with page-specific URL restrictions. |
| Allow any URL in your site | You must set two URLs in theallowedRefererslist.URL for the domain, without a subdomain, and with a wildcard for
  the path. For example:example.com/*A second URL that includes a wildcard for the subdomain and a
  wildcard for the path. For example:*.example.com/* |
| Allow any URL in a single subdomain or naked domain | You must set two URLs in theallowedRefererslist to allow an
    entire domain:URL for the domain, without a trailing slash. For example:www.example.comsub.example.comexample.comA second URL for the domain that includes a wildcard for the path.
  For example:www.example.com/*sub.example.com/*example.com/* |

To restrict your API key to specific websites, use one of the following options:

1. In the Google Cloud console, go to the **Credentials** page:
  [Go to Credentials](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials)
2. Click the name of the API key that you want to restrict.
3. In the **Application restrictions** section, select **HTTP referrers**.
4. For each restriction that you want to add, click **Add an item**, enter
  the restriction, and click **Done**.
5. Click **Save** to save your changes and return to the API key list.

1. Get the ID of the key that you want to restrict.
  The ID is not the same as the display name or the key string. You can get
  the ID by using the
  [gcloud services api-keys listcommand](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/services/api-keys/list)
  to list the keys in your project.
2. Use the
  [gcloud services api-keys updatecommand](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/services/api-keys/update)
  to add HTTP referrer restrictions to an API key.
  Replace the following values:
  - `KEY_ID`: The ID of the key that you want to
    restrict.
  - `ALLOWED_REFERRER_1`: Your HTTP referrer
    restriction.
    You can add as many restrictions as needed; use commas to separate
    the restrictions. You must provide all referrer restrictions with the
    update command; the referrer restrictions provided replace any existing
    referrer restrictions on the key.
  ```
  gcloud services api-keys update KEY_ID \
   --allowed-referrers="ALLOWED_REFERRER_1"
  ```

  to list the keys in your project.
2. Use the
  [gcloud services api-keys updatecommand](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/services/api-keys/update)
  to add server (IP address) restrictions to an API key.
  Replace the following values:
  - `KEY_ID`: The ID of the key that you want to
    restrict.
  - `ALLOWED_IP_ADDR_1`: Your allowed IP address.
    You can add as many IP addresses as needed; use commas to separate
    the addresses.

#### Android apps

You can restrict usage of an API key to specific Android apps. You must provide
the package name and the 20-byte SHA-1 certificate fingerprint for each app.

When you use the API key in a request, you must specify the package name
and certificate fingerprint by using the following HTTP headers:

- `X-Android-Package`
- `X-Android-Cert`

To restrict your API key to one or more Android apps, use one of the following
options:

1. In the Google Cloud console, go to the **Credentials** page:
  [Go to Credentials](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials)
2. Click the name of the API key that you want to restrict.
3. In the **Application restrictions** section, select **Android apps**.
4. For each Android app that you want to add, click **Add an item** and enter
  the package name and SHA-1 certificate fingerprint, then click **Done**.
5. Click **Save** to save your changes and return to the API key list.

#### iOS apps

You can restrict usage of an API key to specific iOS apps by providing the
bundle ID of each app.

When you use the API key in a request, you must specify the bundle ID by using
the `X-Ios-Bundle-Identifier` HTTP header.

To restrict your API key to one or more iOS apps, use one of the following
options:

1. In the Google Cloud console, go to the **Credentials** page:
  [Go to Credentials](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials)
2. Click the name of the API key that you want to restrict.
3. In the **Application restrictions** section, select **iOS apps**.
4. For each iOS app that you want to add, click **Add an item** and enter
  the bundle ID, then click **Done**.
5. Click **Save** to save your changes and return to the API key list.

1. Get the ID of the key that you want to restrict.
  The ID is not the same as the display name or the key string. You can get
  the ID by using the
  [gcloud services api-keys listcommand](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/services/api-keys/list)
  to list the keys in your project.
2. Use the
  [gcloud services api-keys update](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/services/api-keys/update)
  method to specify the iOS apps that can use the key.
  Replace the following values:
  - `KEY_ID`: The ID of the key that you want to
    restrict.
  - `ALLOWED_BUNDLE_ID`: The bundle ID of an iOS app
    that you want to be able to use this API key.
    You can add as many bundle IDs as needed; use commas to separate the
    IDs.
  ```
  gcloud services api-keys update KEY_ID \

in the API Keys API documentation.

### Add API restrictions

API restrictions specify which APIs can be called using the API key.

To add API restrictions, use one of the following options:

1. In the Google Cloud console, go to the **Credentials** page:
  [Go to Credentials](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials)
2. Click the name of the API key that you want to restrict.
3. In the **API restrictions** section, click **Restrict key**.
4. Select all APIs that your API key will be used to access.
5. Click **Save** to save your changes and return to the API key list.

1. Get the ID of the key that you want to restrict.
  The ID is not the same as the display name or the key string. You can get
  the ID by using the
  [gcloud services api-keys listcommand](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/services/api-keys/list)
  to list the keys in your project.
2. Use the
  [gcloud services api-keys updatecommand](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/services/api-keys/update)
  to specify which services an API key can be used to access.
  Replace the following values:
  - `KEY_ID`: The ID of the key that you want to
    restrict.
  - `SERVICE_1`, `SERVICE_2`...:
    The service names of the APIs that the key can be used to access.
    You must provide all service names with the update command; the service
    names provided replace any existing services on the key.
  You can find the service name by searching for the API on the
  [API dashboard](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/dashboard). Service
  names are strings like `bigquery.googleapis.com`.
  ```
  gcloud services api-keys update KEY_ID \
  --api-target=service=SERVICE_1 --api-target=service=SERVICE_2
  ```

To run this sample, you must install the
[google-cloud-apikeysclient library](https://cloud.google.com/java/docs/reference/google-cloud-apikeys/latest/overview).

## Get project information from a key string

You can determine which Google Cloud project an API key is associated with
from its string.

Replace `KEY_STRING` with the key string you need project
information for.

You use the
 [gcloud services api-keys lookupcommand](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/services/api-keys/lookup)
 to get the project ID from a key string.

```

## Create a copy of an API key

If you need a new API key with the same restrictions as an existing API key, you
can create a copy of the existing API key. This operation creates a new API key
with a unique key string and ID, with the existing API key's restrictions.

The copy operation is available only in the Google Cloud console. To use other
methods, follow the steps to [create an API key](#create), and then
[apply the same API key restrictions](#adding-api-restrictions) to the newly
generated API key.

1. In the Google Cloud console, go to the **Credentials** page:
  [Go to Credentials](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials)
2. Click the name of the API key that you want to copy.
  The API key's details page opens.
3. Click **Create a copy**.
4. Enter a name for the new API key and confirm that the restrictions are correct.
5. Click **Create**.

## Rotate an API key

By periodically rotating your API keys, you can limit the impact of any
compromised API keys.

When you rotate an API key, you create a new key with the same restrictions as
the old key, and update your applications to use the new key. After all of your
applications are updated, you delete the old key.

The rotation operation is available only in the Google Cloud console. To use other
methods, follow the steps to [create an API key](#create), and then
[apply the same API key restrictions](#adding-api-restrictions) to the newly
generated API key. After updating your applications to use the new key, you
delete the old key.

1. In the Google Cloud console, go to the **Credentials** page:
  [Go to Credentials](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials)
2. Click the name of the API key that you want to rotate to open its details page.
3. Click **Rotate key**.
4. Enter a name for the new API key and confirm that the restrictions are correct.
5. Click **Create**.
6. Copy the key string and update your applications to use the new string.
7. After you have updated all applications to use the new key, return to the
  details page for the new key. In the **Previous key** section, click
  **Delete the previous key** to delete the old key.
  If you find that you deleted the old key prematurely, you can
  [undelete it](#undelete).

## Undelete an API key

If you delete an API key by mistake, you can undelete (restore) that key within
30 days of deleting the key. After 30 days, you cannot undelete the API key.

1. In the Google Cloud console, go to the **Credentials** page:
  [Go to Credentials](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials)
2. Click **Restore deleted credentials**.
3. Find the deleted API key that you want to undelete, and click **Restore**.
  Undeleting an API key may take a few minutes to propagate. After
  propagation, the undeleted API key is displayed in the API keys list.

1. Get the ID of the key that you want to undelete.
  The ID is not the same as the display name or the key string. You can get
  the ID by using the
  [gcloud services api-keys list --show-deletedcommand](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/services/api-keys/list)
  to list the deleted keys in your project.
2. Use the
  [gcloud services api-keys undeletecommand](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/services/api-keys/undelete)
  to undelete an API key.
  ```
  gcloud services api-keys undelete KEY_ID
  ```
  Replace the following values:
  - `KEY_ID`: The ID of the key that you want to
    undelete.

  method, with the `showDeleted` query parameter set to `true`.
  The key ID is listed in the `uid` field of the response.
  Replace `PROJECT_ID` with your Google Cloud project
  ID or name.
  ```
  curl -X GET \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" \
  "https://apikeys.googleapis.com/v2/projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/global/keys?showDeleted=true"
  ```
2. Use the
  [undelete](https://cloud.google.com/api-keys/docs/reference/rest/v2/projects.locations.keys/undelete)
  method to undelete the API key.
  ```
  curl -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8" \
  "https://apikeys.googleapis.com/v2/projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/global/keys/KEY_ID:undelete"
  ```
  This request
  returns a [long-running operation](#lro); you must poll the operation to
  know when the operation completes and get the operation status.
  Replace the following values:
  - `PROJECT_ID`: Your Google Cloud project ID or
    name.
  - `KEY_ID`: The ID of the key that you want to
    restrict.

## Determine the API key type

You can determine whether the API key is bound to a service account by
inspecting the key.

1. In the Google Cloud console, go to the **Credentials** page:
  [Go to Credentials](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials)
  If the API key is bound to a service account, the service account
  identifier is displayed.

1. Get the ID of the key.
  The ID is not the same as the display name or the key string. You can get
  the ID by using the
  [gcloud services api-keys listcommand](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/services/api-keys/list)
  to list the keys in your project.
2. Use the
  [gcloud services api-keys describecommand](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/services/api-keys/describe)
  to describe the API key.
  ```
  gcloud services api-keys describe KEY_ID
  ```
  If the API key is bound to a service account, the `serviceAccountEmail`
  field is displayed.

## Poll long-running operations

API Keys API methods use long-running operations. If you use the REST API to
create and manage API keys, an operation object is returned from the initial
method request. You use the operation name to poll the long-running operation.
When the long-running request completes, polling the operation returns the
data from the long-running request.

To poll a long-running API Keys API operation, you use the
[operations.get](https://cloud.google.com/api-keys/docs/reference/rest/v2/operations/get) method.

Replace `OPERATION_NAME` with the operation name returned
by the long-running operation. For example,
`operations/akmf.p7-358517206116-cd10a88a-7740-4403-a8fd-979f3bd7fe1c`.

```
curl -X GET \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8" \
    "https://apikeys.googleapis.com/v2/OPERATION_NAME"
```

## Limits on API keys

You can create up to 300 API keys per project. This limit
is a system limit, and can't be changed using a quota increase request.
If more API keys are needed, you must use more than one project.

You can add up to 1200
[application restrictions](#adding-application-restrictions) to an API key.
