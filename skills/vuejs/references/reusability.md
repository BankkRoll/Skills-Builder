# Composables​

TIP

This section assumes basic knowledge of Composition API. If you have been learning Vue with Options API only, you can set the API Preference to Composition API (using the toggle at the top of the left sidebar) and re-read the [Reactivity Fundamentals](https://vuejs.org/guide/essentials/reactivity-fundamentals) and [Lifecycle Hooks](https://vuejs.org/guide/essentials/lifecycle) chapters.

## What is a "Composable"?​

In the context of Vue applications, a "composable" is a function that leverages Vue's Composition API to encapsulate and reuse **stateful logic**.

When building frontend applications, we often need to reuse logic for common tasks. For example, we may need to format dates in many places, so we extract a reusable function for that. This formatter function encapsulates **stateless logic**: it takes some input and immediately returns expected output. There are many libraries out there for reusing stateless logic - for example [lodash](https://lodash.com/) and [date-fns](https://date-fns.org/), which you may have heard of.

By contrast, stateful logic involves managing state that changes over time. A simple example would be tracking the current position of the mouse on a page. In real-world scenarios, it could also be more complex logic such as touch gestures or connection status to a database.

## Mouse Tracker Example​

If we were to implement the mouse tracking functionality using the Composition API directly inside a component, it would look like this:

MouseComponent.vuevue

```
<script setup>
import { ref, onMounted, onUnmounted } from 'vue'

const x = ref(0)
const y = ref(0)

function update(event) {
  x.value = event.pageX
  y.value = event.pageY
}

onMounted(() => window.addEventListener('mousemove', update))
onUnmounted(() => window.removeEventListener('mousemove', update))
</script>

<template>Mouse position is at: {{ x }}, {{ y }}</template>
```

But what if we want to reuse the same logic in multiple components? We can extract the logic into an external file, as a composable function:

mouse.jsjs

```
import { ref, onMounted, onUnmounted } from 'vue'

// by convention, composable function names start with "use"
export function useMouse() {
  // state encapsulated and managed by the composable
  const x = ref(0)
  const y = ref(0)

  // a composable can update its managed state over time.
  function update(event) {
    x.value = event.pageX
    y.value = event.pageY
  }

  // a composable can also hook into its owner component's
  // lifecycle to setup and teardown side effects.
  onMounted(() => window.addEventListener('mousemove', update))
  onUnmounted(() => window.removeEventListener('mousemove', update))

  // expose managed state as return value
  return { x, y }
}
```

And this is how it can be used in components:

MouseComponent.vuevue

```
<script setup>
import { useMouse } from './mouse.js'

const { x, y } = useMouse()
</script>

<template>Mouse position is at: {{ x }}, {{ y }}</template>
```

 Mouse position is at: 0, 0

[Try it in the Playground](https://play.vuejs.org/#eNqNkj1rwzAQhv/KocUOGKVzSAIdurVjoQUvJj4XlfgkJNmxMfrvPcmJkkKHLrbu69H7SlrEszFyHFDsxN6drDIeHPrBHGtSvdHWwwKDwzfNHwjQWd1DIbd9jOW3K2qq6aTJxb6pgpl7Dnmg3NS0365YBnLgsTfnxiNHACvUaKe80gTKQeN3sDAIQqjignEhIvKYqMRta1acFVrsKtDEQPLYxuU7cV8Msmg2mdTilIa6gU5p27tYWKKq1c3ENphaPrGFW25+yMXsHWFaFlfiiOSvFIBJjs15QJ5JeWmaL/xYS/Mfpc9YYrPxl52ULOpwhIuiVl9k07Yvsf9VOY+EtizSWfR6xKK6itgkvQ/+fyNs6v4XJXIsPwVL+WprCiL8AEUxw5s=)

As we can see, the core logic remains identical - all we had to do was move it into an external function and return the state that should be exposed. Just like inside a component, you can use the full range of [Composition API functions](https://vuejs.org/api/#composition-api) in composables. The same `useMouse()` functionality can now be used in any component.

The cooler part about composables though, is that you can also nest them: one composable function can call one or more other composable functions. This enables us to compose complex logic using small, isolated units, similar to how we compose an entire application using components. In fact, this is why we decided to call the collection of APIs that make this pattern possible Composition API.

For example, we can extract the logic of adding and removing a DOM event listener into its own composable:

event.jsjs

```
import { onMounted, onUnmounted } from 'vue'

export function useEventListener(target, event, callback) {
  // if you want, you can also make this
  // support selector strings as target
  onMounted(() => target.addEventListener(event, callback))
  onUnmounted(() => target.removeEventListener(event, callback))
}
```

And now our `useMouse()` composable can be simplified to:

mouse.jsjs

```
import { ref } from 'vue'
import { useEventListener } from './event'

export function useMouse() {
  const x = ref(0)
  const y = ref(0)

  useEventListener(window, 'mousemove', (event) => {
    x.value = event.pageX
    y.value = event.pageY
  })

  return { x, y }
}
```

TIP

Each component instance calling `useMouse()` will create its own copies of `x` and `y` state so they won't interfere with one another. If you want to manage shared state between components, read the [State Management](https://vuejs.org/guide/scaling-up/state-management) chapter.

## Async State Example​

The `useMouse()` composable doesn't take any arguments, so let's take a look at another example that makes use of one. When doing async data fetching, we often need to handle different states: loading, success, and error:

vue

```
<script setup>
import { ref } from 'vue'

const data = ref(null)
const error = ref(null)

fetch('...')
  .then((res) => res.json())
  .then((json) => (data.value = json))
  .catch((err) => (error.value = err))
</script>

<template>
  <div v-if="error">Oops! Error encountered: {{ error.message }}</div>
  <div v-else-if="data">
    Data loaded:
    <pre>{{ data }}</pre>
  </div>
  <div v-else>Loading...</div>
</template>
```

It would be tedious to have to repeat this pattern in every component that needs to fetch data. Let's extract it into a composable:

fetch.jsjs

```
import { ref } from 'vue'

export function useFetch(url) {
  const data = ref(null)
  const error = ref(null)

  fetch(url)
    .then((res) => res.json())
    .then((json) => (data.value = json))
    .catch((err) => (error.value = err))

  return { data, error }
}
```

Now in our component we can just do:

vue

```
<script setup>
import { useFetch } from './fetch.js'

const { data, error } = useFetch('...')
</script>
```

### Accepting Reactive State​

`useFetch()` takes a static URL string as input - so it performs the fetch only once and is then done. What if we want it to re-fetch whenever the URL changes? In order to achieve this, we need to pass reactive state into the composable function, and let the composable create watchers that perform actions using the passed state.

For example, `useFetch()` should be able to accept a ref:

js

```
const url = ref('/initial-url')

const { data, error } = useFetch(url)

// this should trigger a re-fetch
url.value = '/new-url'
```

Or, accept a [getter function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/get#description):

js

```
// re-fetch when props.id changes
const { data, error } = useFetch(() => `/posts/${props.id}`)
```

We can refactor our existing implementation with the [watchEffect()](https://vuejs.org/api/reactivity-core#watcheffect) and [toValue()](https://vuejs.org/api/reactivity-utilities#tovalue) APIs:

fetch.jsjs

```
import { ref, watchEffect, toValue } from 'vue'

export function useFetch(url) {
  const data = ref(null)
  const error = ref(null)

  const fetchData = () => {
    // reset state before fetching..
    data.value = null
    error.value = null

    fetch(toValue(url))
      .then((res) => res.json())
      .then((json) => (data.value = json))
      .catch((err) => (error.value = err))
  }

  watchEffect(() => {
    fetchData()
  })

  return { data, error }
}
```

`toValue()` is an API added in 3.3. It is designed to normalize refs or getters into values. If the argument is a ref, it returns the ref's value; if the argument is a function, it will call the function and return its return value. Otherwise, it returns the argument as-is. It works similarly to [unref()](https://vuejs.org/api/reactivity-utilities#unref), but with special treatment for functions.

Notice that `toValue(url)` is called **inside** the `watchEffect` callback. This ensures that any reactive dependencies accessed during the `toValue()` normalization are tracked by the watcher.

This version of `useFetch()` now accepts static URL strings, refs, and getters, making it much more flexible. The watch effect will run immediately, and will track any dependencies accessed during `toValue(url)`. If no dependencies are tracked (e.g. url is already a string), the effect runs only once; otherwise, it will re-run whenever a tracked dependency changes.

Here's [the updated version ofuseFetch()](https://play.vuejs.org/#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), with an artificial delay and randomized error for demo purposes.

## Conventions and Best Practices​

### Naming​

It is a convention to name composable functions with camelCase names that start with "use".

### Input Arguments​

A composable can accept ref or getter arguments even if it doesn't rely on them for reactivity. If you are writing a composable that may be used by other developers, it's a good idea to handle the case of input arguments being refs or getters instead of raw values. The [toValue()](https://vuejs.org/api/reactivity-utilities#tovalue) utility function will come in handy for this purpose:

js

```
import { toValue } from 'vue'

function useFeature(maybeRefOrGetter) {
  // If maybeRefOrGetter is a ref or a getter,
  // its normalized value will be returned.
  // Otherwise, it is returned as-is.
  const value = toValue(maybeRefOrGetter)
}
```

If your composable creates reactive effects when the input is a ref or a getter, make sure to either explicitly watch the ref / getter with `watch()`, or call `toValue()` inside a `watchEffect()` so that it is properly tracked.

The [useFetch() implementation discussed earlier](#accepting-reactive-state) provides a concrete example of a composable that accepts refs, getters and plain values as input argument.

### Return Values​

You have probably noticed that we have been exclusively using `ref()` instead of `reactive()` in composables. The recommended convention is for composables to always return a plain, non-reactive object containing multiple refs. This allows it to be destructured in components while retaining reactivity:

js

```
// x and y are refs
const { x, y } = useMouse()
```

Returning a reactive object from a composable will cause such destructures to lose the reactivity connection to the state inside the composable, while the refs will retain that connection.

If you prefer to use returned state from composables as object properties, you can wrap the returned object with `reactive()` so that the refs are unwrapped. For example:

js

```
const mouse = reactive(useMouse())
// mouse.x is linked to original ref
console.log(mouse.x)
```

template

```
Mouse position is at: {{ mouse.x }}, {{ mouse.y }}
```

### Side Effects​

It is OK to perform side effects (e.g. adding DOM event listeners or fetching data) in composables, but pay attention to the following rules:

- If you are working on an application that uses [Server-Side Rendering](https://vuejs.org/guide/scaling-up/ssr) (SSR), make sure to perform DOM-specific side effects in post-mount lifecycle hooks, e.g. `onMounted()`. These hooks are only called in the browser, so you can be sure that code inside them has access to the DOM.
- Remember to clean up side effects in `onUnmounted()`. For example, if a composable sets up a DOM event listener, it should remove that listener in `onUnmounted()` as we have seen in the `useMouse()` example. It can be a good idea to use a composable that automatically does this for you, like the `useEventListener()` example.

### Usage Restrictions​

Composables should only be called in `<script setup>` or the `setup()` hook. They should also be called **synchronously** in these contexts. In some cases, you can also call them in lifecycle hooks like `onMounted()`.

These restrictions are important because these are the contexts where Vue is able to determine the current active component instance. Access to an active component instance is necessary so that:

1. Lifecycle hooks can be registered to it.
2. Computed properties and watchers can be linked to it, so that they can be disposed when the instance is unmounted to prevent memory leaks.

TIP

`<script setup>` is the only place where you can call composables **after** using `await`. The compiler automatically restores the active instance context for you after the async operation.

## Extracting Composables for Code Organization​

Composables can be extracted not only for reuse, but also for code organization. As the complexity of your components grows, you may end up with components that are too large to navigate and reason about. Composition API gives you the full flexibility to organize your component code into smaller functions based on logical concerns:

vue

```
<script setup>
import { useFeatureA } from './featureA.js'
import { useFeatureB } from './featureB.js'
import { useFeatureC } from './featureC.js'

const { foo, bar } = useFeatureA()
const { baz } = useFeatureB(foo)
const { qux } = useFeatureC(baz)
</script>
```

To some extent, you can think of these extracted composables as component-scoped services that can talk to one another.

## Using Composables in Options API​

If you are using Options API, composables must be called inside `setup()`, and the returned bindings must be returned from `setup()` so that they are exposed to `this` and the template:

js

```
import { useMouse } from './mouse.js'
import { useFetch } from './fetch.js'

export default {
  setup() {
    const { x, y } = useMouse()
    const { data, error } = useFetch('...')
    return { x, y, data, error }
  },
  mounted() {
    // setup() exposed properties can be accessed on `this`
    console.log(this.x)
  }
  // ...other options
}
```

## Comparisons with Other Techniques​

### vs. Mixins​

Users coming from Vue 2 may be familiar with the [mixins](https://vuejs.org/api/options-composition#mixins) option, which also allows us to extract component logic into reusable units. There are three primary drawbacks to mixins:

1. **Unclear source of properties**: when using many mixins, it becomes unclear which instance property is injected by which mixin, making it difficult to trace the implementation and understand the component's behavior. This is also why we recommend using the refs + destructure pattern for composables: it makes the property source clear in consuming components.
2. **Namespace collisions**: multiple mixins from different authors can potentially register the same property keys, causing namespace collisions. With composables, you can rename the destructured variables if there are conflicting keys from different composables.
3. **Implicit cross-mixin communication**: multiple mixins that need to interact with one another have to rely on shared property keys, making them implicitly coupled. With composables, values returned from one composable can be passed into another as arguments, just like normal functions.

For the above reasons, we no longer recommend using mixins in Vue 3. The feature is kept only for migration and familiarity reasons.

### vs. Renderless Components​

In the component slots chapter, we discussed the [Renderless Component](https://vuejs.org/guide/components/slots#renderless-components) pattern based on scoped slots. We even implemented the same mouse tracking demo using renderless components.

The main advantage of composables over renderless components is that composables do not incur the extra component instance overhead. When used across an entire application, the amount of extra component instances created by the renderless component pattern can become a noticeable performance overhead.

The recommendation is to use composables when reusing pure logic, and use components when reusing both logic and visual layout.

### vs. React Hooks​

If you have experience with React, you may notice that this looks very similar to custom React hooks. Composition API was in part inspired by React hooks, and Vue composables are indeed similar to React hooks in terms of logic composition capabilities. However, Vue composables are based on Vue's fine-grained reactivity system, which is fundamentally different from React hooks' execution model. This is discussed in more detail in the [Composition API FAQ](https://vuejs.org/guide/extras/composition-api-faq#comparison-with-react-hooks).

# Custom Directives​

> Vue.js - The Progressive JavaScript Framework

# Custom Directives​

## Introduction​

In addition to the default set of directives shipped in core (like `v-model` or `v-show`), Vue also allows you to register your own custom directives.

We have introduced two forms of code reuse in Vue: [components](https://vuejs.org/guide/essentials/component-basics) and [composables](https://vuejs.org/guide/reusability/composables). Components are the main building blocks, while composables are focused on reusing stateful logic. Custom directives, on the other hand, are mainly intended for reusing logic that involves low-level DOM access on plain elements.

A custom directive is defined as an object containing lifecycle hooks similar to those of a component. The hooks receive the element the directive is bound to. Here is an example of a directive that adds a class to an element when it is inserted into the DOM by Vue:

vue

```
<script setup>
// enables v-highlight in templates
const vHighlight = {
  mounted: (el) => {
    el.classList.add('is-highlight')
  }
}
</script>

<template>
  <p v-highlight>This sentence is important!</p>
</template>
```

js

```
const highlight = {
  mounted: (el) => el.classList.add('is-highlight')
}

export default {
  directives: {
    // enables v-highlight in template
    highlight
  }
}
```

template

```
<p v-highlight>This sentence is important!</p>
```

This sentence is important!

In `<script setup>`, any camelCase variable that starts with the `v` prefix can be used as a custom directive. In the example above, `vHighlight` can be used in the template as `v-highlight`.

If you are not using `<script setup>`, custom directives can be registered using the `directives` option:

js

```
export default {
  setup() {
    /*...*/
  },
  directives: {
    // enables v-highlight in template
    highlight: {
      /* ... */
    }
  }
}
```

Similar to components, custom directives must be registered so that they can be used in templates. In the example above, we are using local registration via the `directives` option.

It is also common to globally register custom directives at the app level:

js

```
const app = createApp({})

// make v-highlight usable in all components
app.directive('highlight', {
  /* ... */
})
```

It is possible to type global custom directives by extending the `ComponentCustomProperties` interface from `vue`

More Details: [Typing Custom Global Directives](https://vuejs.org/guide/typescript/composition-api#typing-global-custom-directives)

## When to use custom directives​

Custom directives should only be used when the desired functionality can only be achieved via direct DOM manipulation.

A common example of this is a `v-focus` custom directive that brings an element into focus.

vue

```
<script setup>
// enables v-focus in templates
const vFocus = {
  mounted: (el) => el.focus()
}
</script>

<template>
  <input v-focus />
</template>
```

js

```
const focus = {
  mounted: (el) => el.focus()
}

export default {
  directives: {
    // enables v-focus in template
    focus
  }
}
```

template

```
<input v-focus />
```

This directive is more useful than the `autofocus` attribute because it works not just on page load - it also works when the element is dynamically inserted by Vue!

Declarative templating with built-in directives such as `v-bind` is recommended when possible because they are more efficient and server-rendering friendly.

## Directive Hooks​

A directive definition object can provide several hook functions (all optional):

js

```
const myDirective = {
  // called before bound element's attributes
  // or event listeners are applied
  created(el, binding, vnode) {
    // see below for details on arguments
  },
  // called right before the element is inserted into the DOM.
  beforeMount(el, binding, vnode) {},
  // called when the bound element's parent component
  // and all its children are mounted.
  mounted(el, binding, vnode) {},
  // called before the parent component is updated
  beforeUpdate(el, binding, vnode, prevVnode) {},
  // called after the parent component and
  // all of its children have updated
  updated(el, binding, vnode, prevVnode) {},
  // called before the parent component is unmounted
  beforeUnmount(el, binding, vnode) {},
  // called when the parent component is unmounted
  unmounted(el, binding, vnode) {}
}
```

### Hook Arguments​

Directive hooks are passed these arguments:

- `el`: the element the directive is bound to. This can be used to directly manipulate the DOM.
- `binding`: an object containing the following properties.
  - `value`: The value passed to the directive. For example in `v-my-directive="1 + 1"`, the value would be `2`.
  - `oldValue`: The previous value, only available in `beforeUpdate` and `updated`. It is available whether or not the value has changed.
  - `arg`: The argument passed to the directive, if any. For example in `v-my-directive:foo`, the arg would be `"foo"`.
  - `modifiers`: An object containing modifiers, if any. For example in `v-my-directive.foo.bar`, the modifiers object would be `{ foo: true, bar: true }`.
  - `instance`: The instance of the component where the directive is used.
  - `dir`: the directive definition object.
- `vnode`: the underlying VNode representing the bound element.
- `prevVnode`: the VNode representing the bound element from the previous render. Only available in the `beforeUpdate` and `updated` hooks.

As an example, consider the following directive usage:

template

```
<div v-example:foo.bar="baz">
```

The `binding` argument would be an object in the shape of:

js

```
{
  arg: 'foo',
  modifiers: { bar: true },
  value: /* value of `baz` */,
  oldValue: /* value of `baz` from previous update */
}
```

Similar to built-in directives, custom directive arguments can be dynamic. For example:

template

```
<div v-example:[arg]="value"></div>
```

Here the directive argument will be reactively updated based on `arg` property in our component state.

Note

Apart from `el`, you should treat these arguments as read-only and never modify them. If you need to share information across hooks, it is recommended to do so through element's [dataset](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement/dataset).

## Function Shorthand​

It's common for a custom directive to have the same behavior for `mounted` and `updated`, with no need for the other hooks. In such cases we can define the directive as a function:

template

```
<div v-color="color"></div>
```

js

```
app.directive('color', (el, binding) => {
  // this will be called for both `mounted` and `updated`
  el.style.color = binding.value
})
```

## Object Literals​

If your directive needs multiple values, you can also pass in a JavaScript object literal. Remember, directives can take any valid JavaScript expression.

template

```
<div v-demo="{ color: 'white', text: 'hello!' }"></div>
```

js

```
app.directive('demo', (el, binding) => {
  console.log(binding.value.color) // => "white"
  console.log(binding.value.text) // => "hello!"
})
```

## Usage on Components​

Not recommended

Using custom directives on components is not recommended. Unexpected behaviour may occur when a component has multiple root nodes.

When used on components, custom directives will always apply to a component's root node, similar to [Fallthrough Attributes](https://vuejs.org/guide/components/attrs).

template

```
<MyComponent v-demo="test" />
```

template

```

<div> 
  <span>My component content</span>
</div>
```

Note that components can potentially have more than one root node. When applied to a multi-root component, a directive will be ignored and a warning will be thrown. Unlike attributes, directives can't be passed to a different element with `v-bind="$attrs"`.

# Plugins​

> Vue.js - The Progressive JavaScript Framework

# Plugins​

## Introduction​

Plugins are self-contained code that usually add app-level functionality to Vue. This is how we install a plugin:

js

```
import { createApp } from 'vue'

const app = createApp({})

app.use(myPlugin, {
  /* optional options */
})
```

A plugin is defined as either an object that exposes an `install()` method, or simply a function that acts as the install function itself. The install function receives the [app instance](https://vuejs.org/api/application) along with additional options passed to `app.use()`, if any:

js

```
const myPlugin = {
  install(app, options) {
    // configure the app
  }
}
```

There is no strictly defined scope for a plugin, but common scenarios where plugins are useful include:

1. Register one or more global components or custom directives with [app.component()](https://vuejs.org/api/application#app-component) and [app.directive()](https://vuejs.org/api/application#app-directive).
2. Make a resource [injectable](https://vuejs.org/guide/components/provide-inject) throughout the app by calling [app.provide()](https://vuejs.org/api/application#app-provide).
3. Add some global instance properties or methods by attaching them to [app.config.globalProperties](https://vuejs.org/api/application#app-config-globalproperties).
4. A library that needs to perform some combination of the above (e.g. [vue-router](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-router-next)).

## Writing a Plugin​

In order to better understand how to create your own Vue.js plugins, we will create a very simplified version of a plugin that displays `i18n` (short for [Internationalization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internationalization_and_localization)) strings.

Let's begin by setting up the plugin object. It is recommended to create it in a separate file and export it, as shown below to keep the logic contained and separate.

plugins/i18n.jsjs

```
export default {
  install: (app, options) => {
    // Plugin code goes here
  }
}
```

We want to create a translation function. This function will receive a dot-delimited `key` string, which we will use to look up the translated string in the user-provided options. This is the intended usage in templates:

template

```
<h1>{{ $translate('greetings.hello') }}</h1>
```

Since this function should be globally available in all templates, we will make it so by attaching it to `app.config.globalProperties` in our plugin:

plugins/i18n.jsjs

```
export default {
  install: (app, options) => {
    // inject a globally available $translate() method
    app.config.globalProperties.$translate = (key) => {
      // retrieve a nested property in `options`
      // using `key` as the path
      return key.split('.').reduce((o, i) => {
        if (o) return o[i]
      }, options)
    }
  }
}
```

Our `$translate` function will take a string such as `greetings.hello`, look inside the user provided configuration and return the translated value.

The object containing the translated keys should be passed to the plugin during installation via additional parameters to `app.use()`:

js

```
import i18nPlugin from './plugins/i18n'

app.use(i18nPlugin, {
  greetings: {
    hello: 'Bonjour!'
  }
})
```

Now, our initial expression `$translate('greetings.hello')` will be replaced by `Bonjour!` at runtime.

TIP

Use global properties scarcely, since it can quickly become confusing if too many global properties injected by different plugins are used throughout an app.

### Provide / Inject with Plugins​

Plugins also allow us to use `provide` to give plugin users access to a function or attribute. For example, we can allow the application to have access to the `options` parameter to be able to use the translations object.

plugins/i18n.jsjs

```
export default {
  install: (app, options) => {
    app.provide('i18n', options)
  }
}
```

Plugin users will now be able to inject the plugin options into their components using the `i18n` key:

vue

```
<script setup>
import { inject } from 'vue'

const i18n = inject('i18n')

console.log(i18n.greetings.hello)
</script>
```

js

```
export default {
  inject: ['i18n'],
  created() {
    console.log(this.i18n.greetings.hello)
  }
}
```

### Bundle for NPM​

If you further want to build and publish your plugin for others to use, see [Vite's section on Library Mode](https://vitejs.dev/guide/build.html#library-mode).
