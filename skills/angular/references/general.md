# What is Angular?

Angular is a web framework that empowers

  developers to build fast, reliable applications that users love.

   illustration
  Maintained by a dedicated team at Google, Angular provides a broad suite of tools, APIs, and
  libraries to simplify and streamline your development workflow. Angular gives you
  a solid platform on which to build fast, reliable applications that scale with both the size of
  your team and the size of your codebase. Angular.dev is the official home for Angular documentation.
