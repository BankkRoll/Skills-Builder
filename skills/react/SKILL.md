## Usage Guidelines

1. **Identify relevant sections** - Match the user's question to the appropriate reference file(s)
2. **Load minimally** - Only read files directly relevant to the question to conserve context
3. **Cite sources** - Reference specific sections when answering
4. **Combine knowledge** - For complex questions, you may need multiple reference files
