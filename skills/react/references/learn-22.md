# Updating Arrays in State

Arrays are mutable in JavaScript, but you should treat them as immutable when you store them in state. Just like with objects, when you want to update an array stored in state, you need to create a new one (or make a copy of an existing one), and then set state to use the new array.

## Updating arrays without mutation

In JavaScript, arrays are just another kind of object. [Like with objects](https://react.dev/learn/updating-objects-in-state), **you should treat arrays in React state as read-only.** This means that you shouldn’t reassign items inside an array like `arr[0] = 'bird'`, and you also shouldn’t use methods that mutate the array, such as `push()` and `pop()`.

Instead, every time you want to update an array, you’ll want to pass a *new* array to your state setting function. To do that, you can create a new array from the original array in your state by calling its non-mutating methods like `filter()` and `map()`. Then you can set your state to the resulting new array.

Here is a reference table of common array operations. When dealing with arrays inside React state, you will need to avoid the methods in the left column, and instead prefer the methods in the right column:

|  | avoid (mutates the array) | prefer (returns a new array) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| adding | push,unshift | concat,[...arr]spread syntax (example) |
| removing | pop,shift,splice | filter,slice(example) |
| replacing | splice,arr[i] = ...assignment | map(example) |
| sorting | reverse,sort | copy the array first (example) |

Alternatively, you can [use Immer](#write-concise-update-logic-with-immer) which lets you use methods from both columns.

### Pitfall

Unfortunately, [slice](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/slice) and [splice](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/splice) are named similarly but are very different:

- `slice` lets you copy an array or a part of it.
- `splice` **mutates** the array (to insert or delete items).

In React, you will be using `slice` (no `p`!) a lot more often because you don’t want to mutate objects or arrays in state. [Updating Objects](https://react.dev/learn/updating-objects-in-state) explains what mutation is and why it’s not recommended for state.

### Adding to an array

`push()` will mutate an array, which you don’t want:

 $[Fork](https://codesandbox.io/api/v1/sandboxes/define?undefined&environment=create-react-app)

```
import { useState } from 'react';

let nextId = 0;

export default function List() {
  const [name, setName] = useState('');
  const [artists, setArtists] = useState([]);

  return (
    <>
      <h1>Inspiring sculptors:</h1>
      <input
        value={name}
        onChange={e => setName(e.target.value)}
      />
      <button onClick={() => {
        artists.push({
          id: nextId++,
          name: name,
        });
      }}>Add</button>
      <ul>
        {artists.map(artist => (
          <li key={artist.id}>{artist.name}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </>
  );
}
```

/$

Instead, create a *new* array which contains the existing items *and* a new item at the end. There are multiple ways to do this, but the easiest one is to use the `...` [array spread](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_syntax#spread_in_array_literals) syntax:

 $

```
setArtists( // Replace the state  [ // with a new array    ...artists, // that contains all the old items    { id: nextId++, name: name } // and one new item at the end  ]);
```

/$

Now it works correctly:

 $[Fork](https://codesandbox.io/api/v1/sandboxes/define?undefined&environment=create-react-app)

```
import { useState } from 'react';

let nextId = 0;

export default function List() {
  const [name, setName] = useState('');
  const [artists, setArtists] = useState([]);

  return (
    <>
      <h1>Inspiring sculptors:</h1>
      <input
        value={name}
        onChange={e => setName(e.target.value)}
      />
      <button onClick={() => {
        setArtists([
          ...artists,
          { id: nextId++, name: name }
        ]);
      }}>Add</button>
      <ul>
        {artists.map(artist => (
          <li key={artist.id}>{artist.name}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </>
  );
}
```

/$

The array spread syntax also lets you prepend an item by placing it *before* the original `...artists`:

 $

```
setArtists([  { id: nextId++, name: name },  ...artists // Put old items at the end]);
```

/$

In this way, spread can do the job of both `push()` by adding to the end of an array and `unshift()` by adding to the beginning of an array. Try it in the sandbox above!

### Removing from an array

The easiest way to remove an item from an array is to *filter it out*. In other words, you will produce a new array that will not contain that item. To do this, use the `filter` method, for example:

 $[Fork](https://codesandbox.io/api/v1/sandboxes/define?undefined&environment=create-react-app)

```
import { useState } from 'react';

let initialArtists = [
  { id: 0, name: 'Marta Colvin Andrade' },
  { id: 1, name: 'Lamidi Olonade Fakeye'},
  { id: 2, name: 'Louise Nevelson'},
];

export default function List() {
  const [artists, setArtists] = useState(
    initialArtists
  );

  return (
    <>
      <h1>Inspiring sculptors:</h1>
      <ul>
        {artists.map(artist => (
          <li key={artist.id}>
            {artist.name}{' '}
            <button onClick={() => {
              setArtists(
                artists.filter(a =>
                  a.id !== artist.id
                )
              );
            }}>
              Delete
            </button>
          </li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </>
  );
}
```

/$

Click the “Delete” button a few times, and look at its click handler.

 $

```
setArtists(  artists.filter(a => a.id !== artist.id));
```

/$

Here, `artists.filter(a => a.id !== artist.id)` means “create an array that consists of those `artists` whose IDs are different from `artist.id`”. In other words, each artist’s “Delete” button will filter *that* artist out of the array, and then request a re-render with the resulting array. Note that `filter` does not modify the original array.

### Transforming an array

If you want to change some or all items of the array, you can use `map()` to create a **new** array. The function you will pass to `map` can decide what to do with each item, based on its data or its index (or both).

In this example, an array holds coordinates of two circles and a square. When you press the button, it moves only the circles down by 50 pixels. It does this by producing a new array of data using `map()`:

 $[Fork](https://codesandbox.io/api/v1/sandboxes/define?undefined&environment=create-react-app)

```
import { useState } from 'react';

let initialShapes = [
  { id: 0, type: 'circle', x: 50, y: 100 },
  { id: 1, type: 'square', x: 150, y: 100 },
  { id: 2, type: 'circle', x: 250, y: 100 },
];

export default function ShapeEditor() {
  const [shapes, setShapes] = useState(
    initialShapes
  );

  function handleClick() {
    const nextShapes = shapes.map(shape => {
      if (shape.type === 'square') {
        // No change
        return shape;
      } else {
        // Return a new circle 50px below
        return {
          ...shape,
          y: shape.y + 50,
        };
      }
    });
    // Re-render with the new array
    setShapes(nextShapes);
  }

  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={handleClick}>
        Move circles down!
      </button>
      {shapes.map(shape => (
        <div
          key={shape.id}
          style={{
          background: 'purple',
          position: 'absolute',
          left: shape.x,
          top: shape.y,
          borderRadius:
            shape.type === 'circle'
              ? '50%' : '',
          width: 20,
          height: 20,
        }} />
      ))}
    </>
  );
}
```

/$

### Replacing items in an array

It is particularly common to want to replace one or more items in an array. Assignments like `arr[0] = 'bird'` are mutating the original array, so instead you’ll want to use `map` for this as well.

To replace an item, create a new array with `map`. Inside your `map` call, you will receive the item index as the second argument. Use it to decide whether to return the original item (the first argument) or something else:

 $[Fork](https://codesandbox.io/api/v1/sandboxes/define?undefined&environment=create-react-app)

```
import { useState } from 'react';

let initialCounters = [
  0, 0, 0
];

export default function CounterList() {
  const [counters, setCounters] = useState(
    initialCounters
  );

  function handleIncrementClick(index) {
    const nextCounters = counters.map((c, i) => {
      if (i === index) {
        // Increment the clicked counter
        return c + 1;
      } else {
        // The rest haven't changed
        return c;
      }
    });
    setCounters(nextCounters);
  }

  return (
    <ul>
      {counters.map((counter, i) => (
        <li key={i}>
          {counter}
          <button onClick={() => {
            handleIncrementClick(i);
          }}>+1</button>
        </li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
}
```

/$

### Inserting into an array

Sometimes, you may want to insert an item at a particular position that’s neither at the beginning nor at the end. To do this, you can use the `...` array spread syntax together with the `slice()` method. The `slice()` method lets you cut a “slice” of the array. To insert an item, you will create an array that spreads the slice *before* the insertion point, then the new item, and then the rest of the original array.

In this example, the Insert button always inserts at the index `1`:

 $[Fork](https://codesandbox.io/api/v1/sandboxes/define?undefined&environment=create-react-app)

```
import { useState } from 'react';

let nextId = 3;
const initialArtists = [
  { id: 0, name: 'Marta Colvin Andrade' },
  { id: 1, name: 'Lamidi Olonade Fakeye'},
  { id: 2, name: 'Louise Nevelson'},
];

export default function List() {
  const [name, setName] = useState('');
  const [artists, setArtists] = useState(
    initialArtists
  );

  function handleClick() {
    const insertAt = 1; // Could be any index
    const nextArtists = [
      // Items before the insertion point:
      ...artists.slice(0, insertAt),
      // New item:
      { id: nextId++, name: name },
      // Items after the insertion point:
      ...artists.slice(insertAt)
    ];
    setArtists(nextArtists);
    setName('');
  }

  return (
    <>
      <h1>Inspiring sculptors:</h1>
      <input
        value={name}
        onChange={e => setName(e.target.value)}
      />
      <button onClick={handleClick}>
        Insert
      </button>
      <ul>
        {artists.map(artist => (
          <li key={artist.id}>{artist.name}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </>
  );
}
```

/$

### Making other changes to an array

There are some things you can’t do with the spread syntax and non-mutating methods like `map()` and `filter()` alone. For example, you may want to reverse or sort an array. The JavaScript `reverse()` and `sort()` methods are mutating the original array, so you can’t use them directly.

**However, you can copy the array first, and then make changes to it.**

For example:

 $[Fork](https://codesandbox.io/api/v1/sandboxes/define?undefined&environment=create-react-app)

```
import { useState } from 'react';

const initialList = [
  { id: 0, title: 'Big Bellies' },
  { id: 1, title: 'Lunar Landscape' },
  { id: 2, title: 'Terracotta Army' },
];

export default function List() {
  const [list, setList] = useState(initialList);

  function handleClick() {
    const nextList = [...list];
    nextList.reverse();
    setList(nextList);
  }

  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={handleClick}>
        Reverse
      </button>
      <ul>
        {list.map(artwork => (
          <li key={artwork.id}>{artwork.title}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </>
  );
}
```

/$

Here, you use the `[...list]` spread syntax to create a copy of the original array first. Now that you have a copy, you can use mutating methods like `nextList.reverse()` or `nextList.sort()`, or even assign individual items with `nextList[0] = "something"`.

However, **even if you copy an array, you can’t mutate existing itemsinsideof it directly.** This is because copying is shallow—the new array will contain the same items as the original one. So if you modify an object inside the copied array, you are mutating the existing state. For example, code like this is a problem.

 $

```
const nextList = [...list];nextList[0].seen = true; // Problem: mutates list[0]setList(nextList);
```

/$

Although `nextList` and `list` are two different arrays, **nextList[0]andlist[0]point to the same object.** So by changing `nextList[0].seen`, you are also changing `list[0].seen`. This is a state mutation, which you should avoid! You can solve this issue in a similar way to [updating nested JavaScript objects](https://react.dev/learn/updating-objects-in-state#updating-a-nested-object)—by copying individual items you want to change instead of mutating them. Here’s how.

## Updating objects inside arrays

Objects are not *really* located “inside” arrays. They might appear to be “inside” in code, but each object in an array is a separate value, to which the array “points”. This is why you need to be careful when changing nested fields like `list[0]`. Another person’s artwork list may point to the same element of the array!

**When updating nested state, you need to create copies from the point where you want to update, and all the way up to the top level.** Let’s see how this works.

In this example, two separate artwork lists have the same initial state. They are supposed to be isolated, but because of a mutation, their state is accidentally shared, and checking a box in one list affects the other list:

 $[Fork](https://codesandbox.io/api/v1/sandboxes/define?undefined&environment=create-react-app)

```
import { useState } from 'react';

let nextId = 3;
const initialList = [
  { id: 0, title: 'Big Bellies', seen: false },
  { id: 1, title: 'Lunar Landscape', seen: false },
  { id: 2, title: 'Terracotta Army', seen: true },
];

export default function BucketList() {
  const [myList, setMyList] = useState(initialList);
  const [yourList, setYourList] = useState(
    initialList
  );

  function handleToggleMyList(artworkId, nextSeen) {
    const myNextList = [...myList];
    const artwork = myNextList.find(
      a => a.id === artworkId
    );
    artwork.seen = nextSeen;
    setMyList(myNextList);
  }

  function handleToggleYourList(artworkId, nextSeen) {
    const yourNextList = [...yourList];
    const artwork = yourNextList.find(
      a => a.id === artworkId
    );
    artwork.seen = nextSeen;
    setYourList(yourNextList);
  }

  return (
    <>
      <h1>Art Bucket List</h1>
      <h2>My list of art to see:</h2>
      <ItemList
        artworks={myList}
        onToggle={handleToggleMyList} />
      <h2>Your list of art to see:</h2>
      <ItemList
        artworks={yourList}
        onToggle={handleToggleYourList} />
    </>
  );
}

function ItemList({ artworks, onToggle }) {
  return (
    <ul>
      {artworks.map(artwork => (
        <li key={artwork.id}>
          <label>
            <input
              type="checkbox"
              checked={artwork.seen}
              onChange={e => {
                onToggle(
                  artwork.id,
                  e.target.checked
                );
              }}
            />
            {artwork.title}
          </label>
        </li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
}
```

/$

The problem is in code like this:

 $

```
const myNextList = [...myList];const artwork = myNextList.find(a => a.id === artworkId);artwork.seen = nextSeen; // Problem: mutates an existing itemsetMyList(myNextList);
```

/$

Although the `myNextList` array itself is new, the *items themselves* are the same as in the original `myList` array. So changing `artwork.seen` changes the *original* artwork item. That artwork item is also in `yourList`, which causes the bug. Bugs like this can be difficult to think about, but thankfully they disappear if you avoid mutating state.

**You can usemapto substitute an old item with its updated version without mutation.**

 $

```
setMyList(myList.map(artwork => {  if (artwork.id === artworkId) {    // Create a *new* object with changes    return { ...artwork, seen: nextSeen };  } else {    // No changes    return artwork;  }}));
```

/$

Here, `...` is the object spread syntax used to [create a copy of an object.](https://react.dev/learn/updating-objects-in-state#copying-objects-with-the-spread-syntax)

With this approach, none of the existing state items are being mutated, and the bug is fixed:

 $[Fork](https://codesandbox.io/api/v1/sandboxes/define?undefined&environment=create-react-app)

import { useState } from 'react';

let nextId = 3;

];

export default function BucketList() {
  const [myList, setMyList] = useState(initialList);
  const [yourList, setYourList] = useState(
    initialList
  );

  function handleToggleMyList(artworkId, nextSeen) {
    setMyList(myList.map(artwork => {
      if (artwork.id === artworkId) {
        // Create a *new* object with changes
        return { ...artwork, seen: nextSeen };
      } else {
        // No changes
        return artwork;
      }
    }));
  }

  function handleToggleYourList(artworkId, nextSeen) {
    setYourList(yourList.map(artwork => {
      if (artwork.id === artworkId) {
        // Create a *new* object with changes
        return { ...artwork, seen: nextSeen };
      } else {

/$

In general, **you should only mutate objects that you have just created.** If you were inserting a *new* artwork, you could mutate it, but if you’re dealing with something that’s already in state, you need to make a copy.

### Write concise update logic with Immer

Updating nested arrays without mutation can get a little bit repetitive. [Just as with objects](https://react.dev/learn/updating-objects-in-state#write-concise-update-logic-with-immer):

- Generally, you shouldn’t need to update state more than a couple of levels deep. If your state objects are very deep, you might want to [restructure them differently](https://react.dev/learn/choosing-the-state-structure#avoid-deeply-nested-state) so that they are flat.
- If you don’t want to change your state structure, you might prefer to use [Immer](https://github.com/immerjs/use-immer), which lets you write using the convenient but mutating syntax and takes care of producing the copies for you.

Here is the Art Bucket List example rewritten with Immer:

 $[Fork](https://codesandbox.io/api/v1/sandboxes/define?undefined&environment=create-react-app)

```
{
  "dependencies": {
    "immer": "1.7.3",
    "react": "latest",
    "react-dom": "latest",
    "react-scripts": "latest",
    "use-immer": "0.5.1"
  },
  "scripts": {
    "start": "react-scripts start",
    "build": "react-scripts build",
    "test": "react-scripts test --env=jsdom",
    "eject": "react-scripts eject"
  },
  "devDependencies": {}
}
```

/$

Note how with Immer, **mutation likeartwork.seen = nextSeenis now okay:**

 $

```
updateMyTodos(draft => {  const artwork = draft.find(a => a.id === artworkId);  artwork.seen = nextSeen;});
```

/$

This is because you’re not mutating the *original* state, but you’re mutating a special `draft` object provided by Immer. Similarly, you can apply mutating methods like `push()` and `pop()` to the content of the `draft`.

Behind the scenes, Immer always constructs the next state from scratch according to the changes that you’ve done to the `draft`. This keeps your event handlers very concise without ever mutating state.

## Recap

- You can put arrays into state, but you can’t change them.
- Instead of mutating an array, create a *new* version of it, and update the state to it.
- You can use the `[...arr, newItem]` array spread syntax to create arrays with new items.
- You can use `filter()` and `map()` to create new arrays with filtered or transformed items.
- You can use Immer to keep your code concise.

# Updating Objects in State

[Learn React](https://react.dev/learn)[Adding Interactivity](https://react.dev/learn/adding-interactivity)

# Updating Objects in State

State can hold any kind of JavaScript value, including objects. But you shouldn’t change objects that you hold in the React state directly. Instead, when you want to update an object, you need to create a new one (or make a copy of an existing one), and then set the state to use that copy.

### You will learn

- How to correctly update an object in React state
- How to update a nested object without mutating it
- What immutability is, and how not to break it
- How to make object copying less repetitive with Immer

## What’s a mutation?

You can store any kind of JavaScript value in state.

 $

```
const [x, setX] = useState(0);
```

/$

So far you’ve been working with numbers, strings, and booleans. These kinds of JavaScript values are “immutable”, meaning unchangeable or “read-only”. You can trigger a re-render to *replace* a value:

 $

```
setX(5);
```

/$

The `x` state changed from `0` to `5`, but the *number0itself* did not change. It’s not possible to make any changes to the built-in primitive values like numbers, strings, and booleans in JavaScript.

Now consider an object in state:

 $

```
const [position, setPosition] = useState({ x: 0, y: 0 });
```

/$

Technically, it is possible to change the contents of *the object itself*. **This is called a mutation:**

 $

```
position.x = 5;
```

/$

However, although objects in React state are technically mutable, you should treat them **as if** they were immutable—like numbers, booleans, and strings. Instead of mutating them, you should always replace them.

## Treat state as read-only

In other words, you should **treat any JavaScript object that you put into state as read-only.**

This example holds an object in state to represent the current pointer position. The red dot is supposed to move when you touch or move the cursor over the preview area. But the dot stays in the initial position:

 $[Fork](https://codesandbox.io/api/v1/sandboxes/define?undefined&environment=create-react-app)

```
import { useState } from 'react';

export default function MovingDot() {
  const [position, setPosition] = useState({
    x: 0,
    y: 0
  });
  return (
    <div
      onPointerMove={e => {
        position.x = e.clientX;
        position.y = e.clientY;
      }}
      style={{
        position: 'relative',
        width: '100vw',
        height: '100vh',
      }}>
      <div style={{
        position: 'absolute',
        backgroundColor: 'red',
        borderRadius: '50%',
        transform: `translate(${position.x}px, ${position.y}px)`,
        left: -10,
        top: -10,
        width: 20,
        height: 20,
      }} />
    </div>
  );
}
```

/$

The problem is with this bit of code.

 $

```
onPointerMove={e => {  position.x = e.clientX;  position.y = e.clientY;}}
```

/$

This code modifies the object assigned to `position` from [the previous render.](https://react.dev/learn/state-as-a-snapshot#rendering-takes-a-snapshot-in-time) But without using the state setting function, React has no idea that object has changed. So React does not do anything in response. It’s like trying to change the order after you’ve already eaten the meal. While mutating state can work in some cases, we don’t recommend it. You should treat the state value you have access to in a render as read-only.

To actually [trigger a re-render](https://react.dev/learn/state-as-a-snapshot#setting-state-triggers-renders) in this case, **create anewobject and pass it to the state setting function:**

 $

```
onPointerMove={e => {  setPosition({    x: e.clientX,    y: e.clientY  });}}
```

/$

With `setPosition`, you’re telling React:

- Replace `position` with this new object
- And render this component again

Notice how the red dot now follows your pointer when you touch or hover over the preview area:

 $[Fork](https://codesandbox.io/api/v1/sandboxes/define?undefined&environment=create-react-app)

```
import { useState } from 'react';

export default function MovingDot() {
  const [position, setPosition] = useState({
    x: 0,
    y: 0
  });
  return (
    <div
      onPointerMove={e => {
        setPosition({
          x: e.clientX,
          y: e.clientY
        });
      }}
      style={{
        position: 'relative',
        width: '100vw',
        height: '100vh',
      }}>
      <div style={{
        position: 'absolute',
        backgroundColor: 'red',
        borderRadius: '50%',
        transform: `translate(${position.x}px, ${position.y}px)`,
        left: -10,
        top: -10,
        width: 20,
        height: 20,
      }} />
    </div>
  );
}
```

/$

##### Deep Dive

#### Local mutation is fine

Code like this is a problem because it modifies an *existing* object in state:

$

```
position.x = e.clientX;position.y = e.clientY;
```

/$

But code like this is **absolutely fine** because you’re mutating a fresh object you have *just created*:

$

```
const nextPosition = {};nextPosition.x = e.clientX;nextPosition.y = e.clientY;setPosition(nextPosition);
```

/$

In fact, it is completely equivalent to writing this:

$

```
setPosition({  x: e.clientX,  y: e.clientY});
```

/$

Mutation is only a problem when you change *existing* objects that are already in state. Mutating an object you’ve just created is okay because *no other code references it yet.* Changing it isn’t going to accidentally impact something that depends on it. This is called a “local mutation”. You can even do local mutation [while rendering.](https://react.dev/learn/keeping-components-pure#local-mutation-your-components-little-secret) Very convenient and completely okay!

## Copying objects with the spread syntax

In the previous example, the `position` object is always created fresh from the current cursor position. But often, you will want to include *existing* data as a part of the new object you’re creating. For example, you may want to update *only one* field in a form, but keep the previous values for all other fields.

These input fields don’t work because the `onChange` handlers mutate the state:

 $[Fork](https://codesandbox.io/api/v1/sandboxes/define?undefined&environment=create-react-app)

```
import { useState } from 'react';

export default function Form() {
  const [person, setPerson] = useState({
    firstName: 'Barbara',
    lastName: 'Hepworth',
    email: 'bhepworth@sculpture.com'
  });

  function handleFirstNameChange(e) {
    person.firstName = e.target.value;
  }

  function handleLastNameChange(e) {
    person.lastName = e.target.value;
  }

  function handleEmailChange(e) {
    person.email = e.target.value;
  }

  return (
    <>
      <label>
        First name:
        <input
          value={person.firstName}
          onChange={handleFirstNameChange}
        />
      </label>
      <label>
        Last name:
        <input
          value={person.lastName}
          onChange={handleLastNameChange}
        />
      </label>
      <label>
        Email:
        <input
          value={person.email}
          onChange={handleEmailChange}
        />
      </label>
      <p>
        {person.firstName}{' '}
        {person.lastName}{' '}
        ({person.email})
      </p>
    </>
  );
}
```

/$

For example, this line mutates the state from a past render:

 $

```
person.firstName = e.target.value;
```

/$

The reliable way to get the behavior you’re looking for is to create a new object and pass it to `setPerson`. But here, you want to also **copy the existing data into it** because only one of the fields has changed:

 $

```
setPerson({  firstName: e.target.value, // New first name from the input  lastName: person.lastName,  email: person.email});
```

/$

You can use the `...` [object spread](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_syntax#spread_in_object_literals) syntax so that you don’t need to copy every property separately.

 $

```
setPerson({  ...person, // Copy the old fields  firstName: e.target.value // But override this one});
```

/$

Now the form works!

Notice how you didn’t declare a separate state variable for each input field. For large forms, keeping all data grouped in an object is very convenient—as long as you update it correctly!

 $[Fork](https://codesandbox.io/api/v1/sandboxes/define?undefined&environment=create-react-app)

```
import { useState } from 'react';

export default function Form() {
  const [person, setPerson] = useState({
    firstName: 'Barbara',
    lastName: 'Hepworth',
    email: 'bhepworth@sculpture.com'
  });

  function handleFirstNameChange(e) {
    setPerson({
      ...person,
      firstName: e.target.value
    });
  }

  function handleLastNameChange(e) {
    setPerson({
      ...person,
      lastName: e.target.value
    });
  }

  function handleEmailChange(e) {
    setPerson({
      ...person,
      email: e.target.value
    });
  }

  return (
    <>
      <label>
        First name:
        <input
          value={person.firstName}
          onChange={handleFirstNameChange}
        />
      </label>
      <label>
        Last name:
        <input
          value={person.lastName}
          onChange={handleLastNameChange}
        />
      </label>
      <label>
        Email:
        <input
          value={person.email}
          onChange={handleEmailChange}
        />
      </label>
      <p>
        {person.firstName}{' '}
        {person.lastName}{' '}
        ({person.email})
      </p>
    </>
  );
}
```

/$

Note that the `...` spread syntax is “shallow”—it only copies things one level deep. This makes it fast, but it also means that if you want to update a nested property, you’ll have to use it more than once.

##### Deep Dive

#### Using a single event handler for multiple fields

You can also use the `[` and `]` braces inside your object definition to specify a property with a dynamic name. Here is the same example, but with a single event handler instead of three different ones:

$[Fork](https://codesandbox.io/api/v1/sandboxes/define?undefined&environment=create-react-app)

```
import { useState } from 'react';

export default function Form() {
  const [person, setPerson] = useState({
    firstName: 'Barbara',
    lastName: 'Hepworth',
    email: 'bhepworth@sculpture.com'
  });

  function handleChange(e) {
    setPerson({
      ...person,
      [e.target.name]: e.target.value
    });
  }

  return (
    <>
      <label>
        First name:
        <input
          name="firstName"
          value={person.firstName}
          onChange={handleChange}
        />
      </label>
      <label>
        Last name:
        <input
          name="lastName"
          value={person.lastName}
          onChange={handleChange}
        />
      </label>
      <label>
        Email:
        <input
          name="email"
          value={person.email}
          onChange={handleChange}
        />
      </label>
      <p>
        {person.firstName}{' '}
        {person.lastName}{' '}
        ({person.email})
      </p>
    </>
  );
}
```

/$

Here, `e.target.name` refers to the `name` property given to the `<input>` DOM element.

## Updating a nested object

Consider a nested object structure like this:

 $

```
const [person, setPerson] = useState({  name: 'Niki de Saint Phalle',  artwork: {    title: 'Blue Nana',    city: 'Hamburg',    image: 'https://i.imgur.com/Sd1AgUOm.jpg',  }});
```

/$

If you wanted to update `person.artwork.city`, it’s clear how to do it with mutation:

 $

```
person.artwork.city = 'New Delhi';
```

/$

But in React, you treat state as immutable! In order to change `city`, you would first need to produce the new `artwork` object (pre-populated with data from the previous one), and then produce the new `person` object which points at the new `artwork`:

 $

```
const nextArtwork = { ...person.artwork, city: 'New Delhi' };const nextPerson = { ...person, artwork: nextArtwork };setPerson(nextPerson);
```

/$

Or, written as a single function call:

 $

```
setPerson({  ...person, // Copy other fields  artwork: { // but replace the artwork    ...person.artwork, // with the same one    city: 'New Delhi' // but in New Delhi!  }});
```

/$

This gets a bit wordy, but it works fine for many cases:

 $[Fork](https://codesandbox.io/api/v1/sandboxes/define?undefined&environment=create-react-app)

```
import { useState } from 'react';

export default function Form() {
  const [person, setPerson] = useState({
    name: 'Niki de Saint Phalle',
    artwork: {
      title: 'Blue Nana',
      city: 'Hamburg',
      image: 'https://i.imgur.com/Sd1AgUOm.jpg',
    }
  });

  function handleNameChange(e) {
    setPerson({
      ...person,
      name: e.target.value
    });
  }

  function handleTitleChange(e) {
    setPerson({
      ...person,
      artwork: {
        ...person.artwork,
        title: e.target.value
      }
    });
  }

  function handleCityChange(e) {
    setPerson({
      ...person,
      artwork: {
        ...person.artwork,
        city: e.target.value
      }
    });
  }

  function handleImageChange(e) {
    setPerson({
      ...person,
      artwork: {
        ...person.artwork,
        image: e.target.value
      }
    });
  }

  return (
    <>
      <label>
        Name:
        <input
          value={person.name}
          onChange={handleNameChange}
        />
      </label>
      <label>
        Title:
        <input
          value={person.artwork.title}
          onChange={handleTitleChange}
        />
      </label>
      <label>
        City:
        <input
          value={person.artwork.city}
          onChange={handleCityChange}
        />
      </label>
      <label>
        Image:
        <input
          value={person.artwork.image}
          onChange={handleImageChange}
        />
      </label>
      <p>
        <i>{person.artwork.title}</i>
        {' by '}
        {person.name}
        <br />
        (located in {person.artwork.city})
      </p>
      <img
        src={person.artwork.image}
        alt={person.artwork.title}
      />
    </>
  );
}
```

/$

##### Deep Dive

#### Objects are not really nested

An object like this appears “nested” in code:

$

```
let obj = {  name: 'Niki de Saint Phalle',  artwork: {    title: 'Blue Nana',    city: 'Hamburg',    image: 'https://i.imgur.com/Sd1AgUOm.jpg',  }};
```

/$

However, “nesting” is an inaccurate way to think about how objects behave. When the code executes, there is no such thing as a “nested” object. You are really looking at two different objects:

$

```
let obj1 = {  title: 'Blue Nana',  city: 'Hamburg',  image: 'https://i.imgur.com/Sd1AgUOm.jpg',};let obj2 = {  name: 'Niki de Saint Phalle',  artwork: obj1};
```

/$

The `obj1` object is not “inside” `obj2`. For example, `obj3` could “point” at `obj1` too:

$

```
let obj1 = {  title: 'Blue Nana',  city: 'Hamburg',  image: 'https://i.imgur.com/Sd1AgUOm.jpg',};let obj2 = {  name: 'Niki de Saint Phalle',  artwork: obj1};let obj3 = {  name: 'Copycat',  artwork: obj1};
```

/$

If you were to mutate `obj3.artwork.city`, it would affect both `obj2.artwork.city` and `obj1.city`. This is because `obj3.artwork`, `obj2.artwork`, and `obj1` are the same object. This is difficult to see when you think of objects as “nested”. Instead, they are separate objects “pointing” at each other with properties.

### Write concise update logic with Immer

If your state is deeply nested, you might want to consider [flattening it.](https://react.dev/learn/choosing-the-state-structure#avoid-deeply-nested-state) But, if you don’t want to change your state structure, you might prefer a shortcut to nested spreads. [Immer](https://github.com/immerjs/use-immer) is a popular library that lets you write using the convenient but mutating syntax and takes care of producing the copies for you. With Immer, the code you write looks like you are “breaking the rules” and mutating an object:

 $

```
updatePerson(draft => {  draft.artwork.city = 'Lagos';});
```

/$

But unlike a regular mutation, it doesn’t overwrite the past state!

##### Deep Dive

#### How does Immer work?

The `draft` provided by Immer is a special type of object, called a [Proxy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Proxy), that “records” what you do with it. This is why you can mutate it freely as much as you like! Under the hood, Immer figures out which parts of the `draft` have been changed, and produces a completely new object that contains your edits.

To try Immer:

1. Run `npm install use-immer` to add Immer as a dependency
2. Then replace `import { useState } from 'react'` with `import { useImmer } from 'use-immer'`

Here is the above example converted to Immer:

 $[Fork](https://codesandbox.io/api/v1/sandboxes/define?undefined&environment=create-react-app)

```
{
  "dependencies": {
    "immer": "1.7.3",
    "react": "latest",
    "react-dom": "latest",
    "react-scripts": "latest",
    "use-immer": "0.5.1"
  },
  "scripts": {
    "start": "react-scripts start",
    "build": "react-scripts build",
    "test": "react-scripts test --env=jsdom",
    "eject": "react-scripts eject"
  },
  "devDependencies": {}
}
```

/$

Notice how much more concise the event handlers have become. You can mix and match `useState` and `useImmer` in a single component as much as you like. Immer is a great way to keep the update handlers concise, especially if there’s nesting in your state, and copying objects leads to repetitive code.

##### Deep Dive

#### Why is mutating state not recommended in React?

There are a few reasons:

- **Debugging:** If you use `console.log` and don’t mutate state, your past logs won’t get clobbered by the more recent state changes. So you can clearly see how state has changed between renders.
- **Optimizations:** Common React [optimization strategies](https://react.dev/reference/react/memo) rely on skipping work if previous props or state are the same as the next ones. If you never mutate state, it is very fast to check whether there were any changes. If `prevObj === obj`, you can be sure that nothing could have changed inside of it.
- **New Features:** The new React features we’re building rely on state being [treated like a snapshot.](https://react.dev/learn/state-as-a-snapshot) If you’re mutating past versions of state, that may prevent you from using the new features.
- **Requirement Changes:** Some application features, like implementing Undo/Redo, showing a history of changes, or letting the user reset a form to earlier values, are easier to do when nothing is mutated. This is because you can keep past copies of state in memory, and reuse them when appropriate. If you start with a mutative approach, features like this can be difficult to add later on.
- **Simpler Implementation:** Because React does not rely on mutation, it does not need to do anything special with your objects. It does not need to hijack their properties, always wrap them into Proxies, or do other work at initialization as many “reactive” solutions do. This is also why React lets you put any object into state—no matter how large—without additional performance or correctness pitfalls.

In practice, you can often “get away” with mutating state in React, but we strongly advise you not to do that so that you can use new React features developed with this approach in mind. Future contributors and perhaps even your future self will thank you!

## Recap

- Treat all state in React as immutable.
- When you store objects in state, mutating them will not trigger renders and will change the state in previous render “snapshots”.
- Instead of mutating an object, create a *new* version of it, and trigger a re-render by setting state to it.
- You can use the `{...obj, something: 'newValue'}` object spread syntax to create copies of objects.
- Spread syntax is shallow: it only copies one level deep.
- To update a nested object, you need to create copies all the way up from the place you’re updating.
- To reduce repetitive copying code, use Immer.

## Try out some challenges

#### Challenge1of3:Fix incorrect state updates

This form has a few bugs. Click the button that increases the score a few times. Notice that it does not increase. Then edit the first name, and notice that the score has suddenly “caught up” with your changes. Finally, edit the last name, and notice that the score has disappeared completely.

Your task is to fix all of these bugs. As you fix them, explain why each of them happens.

$[Fork](https://codesandbox.io/api/v1/sandboxes/define?undefined&environment=create-react-app)

```
import { useState } from 'react';

export default function Scoreboard() {
  const [player, setPlayer] = useState({
    firstName: 'Ranjani',
    lastName: 'Shettar',
    score: 10,
  });

  function handlePlusClick() {
    player.score++;
  }

  function handleFirstNameChange(e) {
    setPlayer({
      ...player,
      firstName: e.target.value,
    });
  }

  function handleLastNameChange(e) {
    setPlayer({
      lastName: e.target.value
    });
  }

  return (
