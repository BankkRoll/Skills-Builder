These endpoints are currently in public preview and subject to change.

This API documentation is for enterprises on GitHub Enterprise Cloud.

If your enterprise is Copilot Business for non-GHE, please refer to the early access documentation link that was previously shared to you.

These endpoints are only available to authenticated members of the enterprise team's enterprise with classic personal access tokens with the `read:enterprise` [scope](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/oauth-apps/building-oauth-apps/scopes-for-oauth-apps) for `GET` APIs and `admin:enterprise` for other APIs.

These endpoints are not compatible with fine-grained personal access tokens or GitHub App access tokens.

GitHub generates the enterprise team's `slug` from the team `name` and adds the `ent:` prefix.
