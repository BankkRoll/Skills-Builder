# REST API endpoints for interactions

> Use the REST API to set the interaction limit for the users in your organizations and repositories.

## About interactions

Users interact with repositories by commenting, opening issues, and creating pull requests. You can use the REST API to allow people with owner or admin access to temporarily restrict interaction with public repositories to a certain type of user.

# REST API endpoints for issues

> Use the REST API to view and manage issues, including issue assignees, comments, labels, and milestones.

The REST API is now versioned. For more information, see "[About API versioning](https://docs.github.com/rest/overview/api-versions)."
